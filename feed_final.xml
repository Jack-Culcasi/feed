										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have already tried to build an ark for forgotten grape varieties, and our list is still populated by examples of the rare and autochthonous. Sometimes they feature gloriously on their own – Gringet from Les Vins de Belema or Ribeyrenc Noir from Thierry Navarre, in other examples they will be part of a “blouge-y” field blend of mingled reds and whites such as Florent Plageoles Terroirists Printemps. When commercial imperatives push consumers towards the tried and tested – and the homogenous – it is wonderful to see producers reviving and replanting traditional varieties and giving us the opportunity to sample different flavours in wines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, a big mention in dispatches for the Romorantin grape. Legend has it that Romorantin was introduced to the Loire by King Francis 1 (1494–1547). The commune of Romorantin-Lanthenay not far from the grape’s stronghold in Cheverny, suggesting that the grape’s name reflects a geographical connection – the king was from the region.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNA fingerprinting has shown that Romorantin is one of many grapes to be the result of a cross between Gouais Blanc and Pinot Fin Teinturier, making it a sibling of Chardonnay, amongst others.</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNA fingerprinting has shown that Romorantin is one of many grapes to be the result of a cross between Gouais Blanc and Pinot Fin Teinturier, making it a sibling of Chardonnay, amongst others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romorantin is the designated grape for Cour-Cheverny appellation and around thirty producers work with it. Its reputation is being secured by natural wine growers who see its potential and are able to produce extraordinary wines from it.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_9039" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9039" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Puzelat-small.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-9039 size-full" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Puzelat-small.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="299" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Puzelat-small.jpg 448w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Puzelat-small-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9039" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Thierry Puzelat</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Puzelat family have worked with the grape for some time. Originally, it was as part of a joint project with Pierre-Olivier Bonhomme and a centenarian vineyard (planted on French rootstock). This wine was a veritable </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">vin de garde</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and had an intensity that lingered remarkably on the palate. Aromas jostled for attention: lemon and chalk followed by mixed white fruits (white peaches, Mirabelle plums, pears), honey, almonds and clean, minerally scents reminiscent of finely-spun wool. It was complex on the palate, too, extremely vinous showing lemon-cream and honey. Ripe apple juiciness gave way to tart, steely acidity that sings like a taut violin string, providing balance and structure for the full, luscious fruit. On the second day the acidity became steelier and more penetrating, the flinty minerality more pronounced taking on back notes of ginger, white pepper, pear-skin and hell’s granny smiths…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recent versions have been from younger vineyards planted to selection massale vines. From here, the wines are more fluid, expressing a bright chalky freshness. The latest vintage is almost a weightless 11%.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11636" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11636" style="width: 326px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-16-at-9.50.47-AM.png"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-11636 " src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-16-at-9.50.47-AM.png" alt="" width="326" height="509" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-16-at-9.50.47-AM.png 360w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-16-at-9.50.47-AM-192x300.png 192w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11636" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Hervé Villemade </em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hervé Villemade, in Cour-Cheverny, makes two versions of Romorantin. We import “Les Acacias”, a wine characterised by its power and sheer intensity. Here the fleshy apricot fruit melds with a touch of oxidation and creates a multi-layered wine with liquorice bitters, warm ginger and fine tannins. The grapes are from vines average 50+-year-old and the wine is half-fermented in amphora and half in demi-muid before ageing in same vessels for 14 months with a further 10 months thereafter in bottle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nature admits no lie”, as Carlyle said, and Courtois (Claude) often says that his wine is made from “true grapes.” The wines he and Etienne craft are pure and vibrantly alive, testament to outstanding farming and precise winemaking. Claude, as we know, is one of the wild men of the region, fierce, generous and capricious, guiding beautiful, naturally expressive wines to the bottle. There is something about Romorantin with almost sherry aromas of oxidation and this example grows in the glass as if eating the oxygen that should be destroying it. The texture evolves into lanolin; warmth pervades the mouth. It is like nothing you have ever tasted, and one imagines that every time one tries the wine it will be a different experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trouble with jargon is that it is catching. We consciously (or unconsciously) echo this </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">slanguage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as if using certain hackneyed words or expressions is the only way to grab people’s attention and to allow us to speak with apparent authority on a particular issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wine trade rejoices in its own gobbledegook, an unironic buzzword-ridden lexicon of banality that seems to proclaim by virtue of its very usage that the wine industry is hard-wired into professional practice. If it quacks like a professional, it must be a professional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s bust some jargon. God forbid that we ever think that wine is a beautiful beverage made from hand-plucked grapes grown in an idyllic vineyard and that we are the storytellers as well as the sellers of the product. There is too much emphasis on magic marketing, of each and every wine being seen as a brand that needs to be packaged in a particular way and sold to expectation.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wine trade rejoices in its own gobbledegook, an unironic buzzword-ridden lexicon of banality that seems to proclaim by virtue of its very usage that the wine industry is hard-wired into professional practice. If it quacks like a professional, it must be a professional.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably, my favourite hate-word is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">premiumisation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s the -isation that sends me over the edge. It is the art/science of persuading people to spend more money on a bottle of wine by making that wine an aspirational product (another pet hate term). You want consumers to examine their choices, recognise extra quality, and consequently voluntarily choose to go up a rung on the wine spend ladder.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Segmentation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in business is the process of dividing a broad market into smaller, more specific groups of customers based on shared characteristics like demographics, needs, or behaviours. This allows companies to create more effective marketing, product development, and sales strategies by tailoring their efforts to the unique preferences of each segment. Treating people like they are individuals? Whatever next? Marketing treats individuals as consumer units, views behaviour via algorithms. Surely, the wine is the wine is the wine, and the human being is a bundle of complex impulses, thoughts and feelings. I don’t want to wake up every day feeling as if  I am a mere </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">segment</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Wine and PR companies constantly have meetings to explore their strategic options with the purpose of finding ways and means of obtaining greater recognition for  &#8211; and selling – (more) products. The more one agonises about strategy, the further away one is from the wines themselves and the people who choose wine on its merits.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">SKU</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Pronounced skew. Eww! Short for stock keeping unit, a unique, alphanumeric code assigned by a company to a specific product for internal inventory management. These are wines, not numbers. “I am not a number, I am a free man!” shouted Patrick McGoohan at the beginning of each episode of The Prisoner. Wines are not numbers, not names evening, but compressed histories.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand (brand recognition)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – It is almost impossible not to use the b word in everyday wine conversation. We do all in our power to dissociate ourselves from the term, yet without doubt, larger and more famous estates become de facto brands by virtue of their reputation. A branded product is normally a consistent one – certainly at the cheaper end, where supermarket shelves are largely populated by wines from companies that churn out the same labels, the same wines, year upon year.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">God forbid that we ever think that wine is a beautiful beverage made from hand-plucked grapes grown in an idyllic vineyard and that we are the storytellers as well as the sellers of the product.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boutique </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">derives from the word for a small (usually specialist) shop, but has come to mean fashionable, exclusive and niche. In wine parlance, it might refer to a small-production wine made by artisan methods. In reality, boutique wines seem to mean </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cuvees that are made at a higher-end price point  and in lower quantities.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launch,</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiative</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – A marketing idea. Many initiatives involve giving pr companies money to plant stories in as many trade journals as possible to launch the product in question. In that sense, a product is launched when journalists/trade magazines give it the oxygen of publicity. The brand money is talking, but who is listening? High volume, relentless exposure surely does have an effect in terms of building recognition for a brand, but in the professional world of wine, any wine cannot rest on its laurels. It needs to be tasted, assessed – not just by journalists – but the very individuals who are in a position to buy it and sell it on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jargon is used in a more tongue-in-cheek way in the natural wine sphere. We talk of unicorns (wines so unobtainable that they have an almost mythic status) and bangers (wines that are very good indeed). We also use a lot of flip terms as shorthand for complex concepts. Language doesn’t have to be precise when talking about wine, particularly one’s personal impressions. One should call out the prevalence of frankly ugly terminology that depersonalises wine and treats it as a functional business product. Especially when that wine is a living product and a soulful thing and gives rise to moments of deep appreciation and pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Doctor Who episode &#8220;Robot of Sherwood,&#8221; the Doctor angrily declares: &#8220;That isn&#8217;t even funny. That was bantering. I am totally against bantering.”  Wine has come a long way since the hushed recommendations in gentlemen’s clubs, arcane classification systems and equally arcane terminology. Over the past forty years wine has been demystified for new generations of drinkers in various ways and the fact younger drinkers feel confident enough to banter about a subject once considered the sole parole of the middle-aged upper middle class “elite” shows how relaxed we have become about wine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New tropes still replace old ones, snobbery becomes reverse snobbery, and the language and rituals surrounding wine constantly changes. Plus ça change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to pretend we are above “all that”, but (whether knowingly or otherwise) we do say and do things about and around wine that mark us as playing the wine bantz game.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wine has come a long way since the hushed recommendations in gentlemen’s clubs, arcane classification systems and equally arcane terminology.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The important rule here is to be truthful. Of course, no-one wants to be stereotyped as Nerd of Nerd Hall, a walking decanter full of wine cliches, and we acknowledge that it is nigh impossible, when gathered together with a group of fellow wine-lovers, not to fall victim to clubby wine banter. This quiz, however, is designed (if that is not too much of an exaggeration) to see whether you might be in danger of tipping over into the self-parodic wine lover extraordinaire or whether you still possess a modicum of detachment. Reverse bonus points are available (see questions underneath the main quiz) to mitigate against pretension.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It just struck me. Next year, I will have worked 30 years for one company. The days of wine. Laughs, we had a few.  Allow me to clamber creakily into my rocking chair by the fire, while I reminisce in quavery tones about the good old days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the changes I have witnessed in our business over the years have been commercially-driven, others the result of cultural shifts. Resist the urge to use the word paradigm. The way we sell, talk about, even drink, wine has changed considerably, as it will always change, with the emergence of new generations of drinkers. Currently, the wine trade is agonising (for which read &#8216;beating itself up&#8217;) about the preferences of Generation Z, how to capture the hearts, minds, and above all, the purchasing power, of the next age of young consumers. Grouping whole generations into these preference categories is exactly the pointless activity that gives us wine trade folk unnecessary heebie-jeebies. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Doug-book.avif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11618 aligncenter" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Doug-book.avif" alt="" width="437" height="554" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of my unreliable memories about life in the trade are recounted in <a href="https://www.the-buyer.net/opinion/doug-wreggs-history-of-les-caves-de-pyrene-in-10-1-2-chapters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A History of an Unusual Wine Company in 10 ½ Chapters,</a> a biography recounting the progress of a small caterpillar group of naïve/intrepid wine sellers becoming a more professional butterfly company that ultimately reached (one way or another) a worldwide audience whilst managing to retain its ideals and much of its original identity. In the sense that whenever we tried something different, trade people would roll their eyes and utter comments such as: “that’s such a Les Caves de Pyrene thing to do!” As well as being a celebration of our sheer existence, the book related various instances of being original, taking risks and sticking to principles. It recounted examples of where success was arguably down to believing in what you were doing (and enjoying the ride). Inasmuch as there was a moral to the book, it was that fond ideas can become reality if you work hard enough to make it happen. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I joined Les Caves de P, we numbered four bodies in total. With a battered van and unknown wines matched by our unknown reputation, we were propelled by some strange romantic love of wines of south west France and the Languedoc. It was like supporting a team in the lower reaches of one of football’s nether leagues. You felt that others admired your devotion to a lost cause but would never take you seriously as a vendor of wines.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this sounds suspiciously like the pious nostrums spouted in self-help books, believe me that luck, serendipity and naïve stubbornness certainly played a part in getting to where we are today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As personnel were replaced over time, the nature of the company was also bound to change. Somehow, we became bigger. Relatively secure and successful. The days of trampled shoe leather and ear fleas are a distant memory, although a scant few of us can still remember what it was like to be on our uppers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I joined Les Caves de P, we numbered four bodies in total. Most of the business came out of our small shop in Guildford. We hawked wines to a handful of local Surrey bistros plus a few French restaurants in London. With a battered van and unknown wines matched by our unknown reputation, we were propelled by some strange romantic love of wines of south west France and the Languedoc. It was like supporting a team in the lower reaches of one of football’s nether leagues. You felt that others admired your devotion to a lost cause but would never take you seriously as a vendor of wines.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autres temps, autres mœurs.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without publicity or notoriety in the trade, leads were few and far between.  And without the internet, no-one could “look us up” and see what we were about. We were thus ploughing a very lonely furrow.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, wine information in general was equally hard to come by. Classic books were our oracles. Jancis Robinson listed her noble grape varieties in Wines, Vines &amp; Grape Varieties. Hugh Johnson, Michael Broadbent, Serena Sutcliffe, Steven Spurrier and Oz Clarke were heavyweights of the wine lit scene. Wine courses taught received wine wisdom. all about the classic regions and varieties. We were at best the obscure row of Aligoté next to a grand cru vineyard. (Okay this is out-of-date – we all prize Aligoté now!). Our artillery, such as it was, was confined to smart-value vin de pays from southern France and some Gascon appellation wines. Was the wine world clamouring for these wines? Was it heck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sell wine, one had to be thick-skinned and persistent. The cold-often frigid-call was the only means of contacting a prospect. Effectively this rocking up on someone’s doorstep with a polite smile, proffering a wine catalogue with a business card, was like shouting into a hurricane. Occasionally, you might leave an open bottle in the hope that it would be sampled and be the siren song for its virtues, prompting an instant desire to list it. However, if a restaurateur or sommelier didn’t want you hanging around, you left. In other words, don’t call us, we’ll call you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other, and perhaps more effective, method was to network like crazy. Attend any and every tasting, party or dinner regardless of merit, eat the rubber chicken, and pump people for information in the nicest possible way. Social milieus were neutral territory. Outside the adversarial buyer/seller context, you were able to be yourself as well as use these moments of brief camaraderie to acquire information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discovering who to sell to was tricky enough, let alone ascertain the names of responsible buyers at each establishment. There was no Instagram or Linked In to look up which would might you to piece together the relevant information. Our reference points were invariably The Good Food Guide, Egon Ronay, Time Out Restaurant Guide and Harden’s. And gossiping with fellow trade members. Nowadays, one can open a restaurant or retail web page, look at the wine list and decide whether the target is suitable, and if so, how to approach it and whom you should talk to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you weren’t traipsing in off the street on the off chance, contacting potential customers had to be done using a landline. So quaint! In which case, one had to navigate the gatekeepers of the switchboard or a stern manager who would evaluate whether your call was either useful or desirable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mirabile dictu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you managed to snag your customer-victim and sell them some wine, then conveying information and keeping them au courant was not a cinch. In the 1990s, we were still sending letters and faxing (thanks to Alexander Bain – not the grower in Pouilly-Fumé!) and Giovanni Castelli for that little invention).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-mailing is the natural order of the day now, although we have customers who hardly ever respond even on this simple medium and require texting, Whats-Apping, or Insta-messaging to elicit any response.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sell wine, one had to be thick-skinned and persistent. The cold-often frigid-call was the only means of contacting a prospect. Effectively this rocking up on someone’s doorstep with a polite smile, proffering a wine catalogue with a business card was like shouting into a hurricane. Occasionally, you might leave an open bottle in the hope that it would be sampled and be the siren song for its virtues, prompting an instant desire to list it. However, if a restaurateur or sommelier didn’t want you hanging around, you left. In other words, don’t call us, we’ll call you!</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contacts are easier to come by these days. With history under our belts and somewhat of a reputation, potential customers will contact us. To convert speculative interest into a living, breathing, interesting account requires diligent nurturing, the best of sales craft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wine scene has altered dramatically in thirty years. Whereas once a few merchants operated in the wine trade,  now there are a few hundred. And whereas once a wine buyer in an establishment would have a relationship with the owner of a company, now buying is mediated through wine reps, sales desks, credit control, and automated ordering. Efficiency is prized as much as quality. In a frenzied competitive market, sales reps in wine companies are running around more and more chasing business, because they are worried that they will lose customers to competitors who will put together better offers. As the Red Queen says in Alice in Wonderland: “Here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And money is key.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On one level of business, wine lists are no longer about wine and are instead simple revenue-raising commodity brochures. Now, you have to formulate proposals for inspection in order to be nominated to supply a group. This will involve form-filling, contracts, incentives, targets, and in many cases, financial rewards. Money has never talked louder than it does at this moment, and major wine companies will need to use brand support to clinch these big one or two year contracts. This bidding for business has an inflationary effect. Big restaurant groups are demanding hundreds and thousands of pounds for sole supply. Big wine companies are acceding to these demands. Wine policy is increasingly dictated by accountants and shareholders. The biggest deal is usually seen as the best deal. Wine is just a by-product in these cases. Large wine companies are effectively buying business turnover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the above disadvantages smaller companies, they don’t have to worry about losing business to the next big bidder that comes along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arguably, the two most common words in the wine world are gross and profit (GP for short). Remember the days of 66.7% gross profit margins? Pepperidge Farm remembers. I can remember further back than that! When you could easily populate a list with exceptional wines under £30. When cash margins were as much the rule as the exception. When the bean counter mentality did not dominate discourse and actions. Glass price ceilings were made to be broken, but price rises on wine lists have been exponential rather than gradual. With some virtuous exceptions, there are few establishments that don’t adhere rigorously to high margins (which so penalises the adventurous drinker). With the cost of wine increasing year on year, the value of wine in restaurants has gone down and down, making it an almost luxury commodity for diners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a more positive note, wine service overall has changed for the better. As a former sommelier, I have never been a fan of often intimidating, overly-formal wine service. Somms are usually younger, more engaging, more travelled, more open-minded, more willing to listen and communicate. There are now so many more women in the wine trade. And younger people too.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the other changes that have occurred over the past thirty years. In no particular order:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The irresistible rise of organic wines, biodynamic wines and natural wines. Even twenty-five years ago, the concept of an organic wine was unusual, biodynamic farming was considered a voodoo science practised purely by eccentrics, and the natural wine scene did not exist at all. Scroll on a quarter of a century…</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proliferation of the wine (and other gastronomic) fairs and ancillary events (such as wine conferences). Is all the hoop-la sustainable? No, but deemed necessary, in the sense of if there is one thing worse than being talked about, that is not being talked about. Even if a winemaker has no wine to sell, they will still attend a fair to be part of the general conversation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disappearance of the national newspaper wine column. Pepperidge Farm remembers the great wine columnists who would craft beautiful discursive prose. Editors now give their wine writers very short shrift, and the columns have dwindled into brief pieces padded with supermarket wine of the month recommendations. The better wine columns and information sites have disappeared behind paywalls and are aimed at professionals. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth of the monetisation of wine and advertorial writing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media replacing the authoritative wine expert as a means of communicating about wine. Viral word of mouth, the picture and meme painting a thousand words.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demystification of wine through wine courses.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proliferation of podcasts. Guilty as charged! The success of this format is down to the busy lives we lead. There are two types of podcasts: one is polished to a fault, cleverly edited, and designed to stand the test of wine. The mission here is to inform. The other is a rough cut with likeminded people rapping about whatever topic moves them. #justanotherwinepodcast is in the latter mould, mixing information and opinion in equal measure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proliferation of jargon when describing wine. My bête-noire is a tasting note that sounds like a cross between a regurgitated thesaurus and the fruits being proffered at Goblin Market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving away from new oak maturation in certain regions to reflect changing taste in markets around the world. One of my wine mentors used to describe certain wines as tasting like under-wined oak. These wines are still being made, but are they still being drunk?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word “terroir” deployed willy-nilly. Although the expression has been used since the 15</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, it has become a marketing tool for a lot of producers who make distinctly un-terroir-like wines!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth of wine tourism. Travel is so easy, that so many regions are accessible. Wineries have set themselves up to receive visitors and do cellar door sales (good for margins).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appellation becoming irrelevant. Partly because so many appellations have been devalued by the oppressive bureaucracy that runs them, often driving the best and most innovative producers to leave the system.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wine lists are still being </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">curated</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This reminds me of the 11</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doctor saying: I could be a curator. I&#8217;d be great at curating, I&#8217;d be &#8220;The Great Curator.&#8221; I have a feeling this pompous word  &#8211; used in conjunction with wine lists &#8211; originated in the US and is much beloved by PR companies to suggest a grand artistic endeavour. In short, it means putting together a bunch of wines you like from your favourite suppliers. Assembling a balanced list of good value wines involves knowledge and common sense – neither rocket science or artistic credentials.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wine being treated as booze/alcohol by a succession of governments, as a cash cow, a commodity to be taxed.  I admit, I am pro wine. It is not just any drink. Wine has formed a part of culture and civilisation for thousands of years. Governments see all alcohol as the enemy. This is cultural philistinism meets joyless Presbyterianism wrapped up in something or other!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Trends… </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yakety yak English wine. This is, of course, now a thing. The real proof will be to taste whether the country’s still wines progress over the next few years (with vineyards experiencing the positive effects of climate change &#8211; big if). Commercial interest in English wine has increased greatly and this has manifested in an aggressive PR campaign. However, the still wines are relatively overpriced, and the quality rarely matches what you might buy from various other countries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia (and her wine) have been discovered –the darling of the left-field wine enthusiast. Wine pilgrims beat a reverential path to Georgia to rediscover their love of wine culture. Georgia reciprocates, welcoming them with open arms, endless feasts, and plenty of incapacitating chacha.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the wane – the regard for Californian and Australian wines in the UK. This is not a scientific observation, but, whether it is price or carbon footprint or ineffectual pr or simply a desire from restaurant and retail buyers to major in European wines, these particular countries are not as apparently popular as they once were. To be fair, the UK market is probably not very important to Californian producers and the wine industry, and Australian wines are still very much part of our wine culture, albeit less dominant than they used to be in their 80s and 90s heydays.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growth in rosé and white wine drinking at the expense of red wine. We can thank a mixture of climate change, the new generation of wine consumers who prefer lighter and brighter wines, and the middle class embracing a more Mediterranean diet and wanting wines to match. Wine is no longer only encountered in posh restaurants; it is drunk in pubs and bars, drunk in parks, viewed as a refreshing drink, something to relax around and socialise with. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange/skin contact wine! – Georgian wines, Gravner, Radikon and the Friuli gang may have started the orange bang, but their influence has spread to winemakers throughout the world. The popularity of these wines (sometimes referred to as the fourth colour of wine) is evidenced by listings in restaurants and on the shelves of independent retailers. The orange wine phenomenon exploded between 2015 and 2022, being associated with the growth in popularity of natural wines. The new, more adventurous, drinkers loved the textural nature of the wines, which offered them the structure of red with some of the feeling of whites.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Spain – the name of a book, but also the move away from massively oaky wine styles towards more gastronomic wines. Spanish producers began to rediscover indigenous varieties, old vineyards, and make wines with a lighter touch. So, let’s acknowledge:</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-fortified sherry. Sherry has always been about how wine develops over time in the cellar. But what if the wines were not fortified and farming was not just a means to produce grapes for a process? The wine world is full of experimentation, which in itself is often the rediscovery of traditional methods. Which is why we are witnessing more wines being made… </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">flor</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We can be fairly certain that veneration of the Jura vin jaune has played a part here. But not all flor winemaking takes the process to such an extreme. Flor is a tool for the winemaker, and its presence gives a unique accent to the wine affected by it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PET NAT! (and ancestral/col fondo wines). The market may be nearing saturation here. Many are seasonal in that you would drink them late spring into summer. Some producers are experimenting with later releases and extended lees ageing to bridge the style gap between pet nats and traditional method sparkling wines.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austrian oak! A.K.A. you had me at Stockinger. These barrels are the ultimate wine accessory (let’s give a nod and a wink to eggs and amphorae).</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9275.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11613 aligncenter" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9275.jpg" alt="" width="534" height="688" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9275.jpg 1170w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9275-233x300.jpg 233w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9275-796x1024.jpg 796w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9275-768x989.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly small and beautiful</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So many tastings, so little time. So say probably most of our customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is the calendar crammed with massive international fairs, conferences and symposiums, but back at home, there are more tasting dates (all shapes and sizes) than a dried fruit depository.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of these are the same-old, same-old. Wines opened and poured, fact sheets fact-checked, ten-second blurred transactions. The large-scale ones are completely impersonal, often dwarfed by their surroundings, commercial examples of “feel the width”. One company went full throttle by annexing The Royal Opera House to show off their wines. Good for them! Then there is the hipster-friendly grungy location, in a dive or a bar, or a gallery or using a blank space. Some tastings are blink-and-you-will-miss-them, pop up in restaurants between service, a more guerrilla-type approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Les Caves de Pyrene held six events in London and one each in Leeds and Manchester, as well as wine dinners and grower takeovers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a useful point to generic tastings? Only customers can say. Do they attend for a specific reason (changing a list, educational purpose, the social catch-up). Does a tasting result in new listings and quantifiable sales? If the follow up is precise and immediate and the attendees in question kept notes and had a keen feeling about certain wines.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Les Caves de Pyrene held six events in London and one each in Leeds and Manchester, as well as wine dinners and grower takeovers.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or are most tastings a form of PR mood music, to remind our customers that we exist, showing that we can put on a good event, that our selection of wines is strong, that we have identifiable specialisms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, trade customers are becoming blasé about tastings. Something always seems to come up. An attendance of 50% and above is remarkable these days. In one sense, this is understandable, when one tasting morphs into another. Disappointing when you know how much time goes into organising an event.</span></p>
<h2><b>The New Old Georgia</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.30.51-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-11462 aligncenter" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.30.51-AM.png" alt="" width="546" height="541" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.30.51-AM.png 472w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.30.51-AM-300x297.png 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.30.51-AM-150x150.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organised in cahoots with <a href="https://www.sagerandwine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sager &amp; Wine</a>, our 2025 tasting season kicked off at Lyle’s (RIP) and marked the arrival of all new vintages and some new wines from Georgia, the aim being to demonstrate the diversity of wines from that country, from the more traditional and deeper skin-contact wines to the fresher, less extractive styles. With examples from twenty-one producers making wine in nine separate regions of the country, this was indeed a wine tour de Georgia, featuring some of the most reputed and innovative growers.</span></p>
<h2><b>Savoie Faire x (Arguably) The First and Last Comparative Gringet Tasting</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Savoie portfolio is small but perfectly formed with delicious wines made from unique, indigenous grapes. We saw an opportunity to pop open exciting regional examples ranging from glacial Chasselas to brooding Mondeuse. The double-header tasting also featured a separate homage to the late Dominique Belluard, who famously (if you are a wine nerd!) championed the native Gringet grape, a variety found locally in Ayze in the Haute-Savoie. To this end, we gathered fifteen iterations of Gringet, two from Dominique, the rest from his friends (mostly from the 2021 vintage). Gringet proved to be a noble variety, each producer imprinting their personality onto the wine in question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Savoie wine of the tasting – everything was bang on, but the Les Vignes du Paradis wines were exceptional</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gringet of the tasting: Ganevat’s Le Feu (although Lapalu’s Feu Follet was beautiful, too).</span></p>
<h2><b>More Splosh For Your Dosh</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.33.28-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-11463 aligncenter" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.33.28-AM.png" alt="" width="548" height="539" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.33.28-AM.png 587w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.33.28-AM-300x295.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had been noting the dip in average wine spend from both our on-trade and retail customers and felt that it would be a good idea to prove that one could buy wines at a relatively painless price without compromising quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bang-for-buck as a tasting title being </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">verboten</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it was a toss-up between the uber-whimsical tagline above (the other being More Splash For Your Cash). Well, we like a bit of vulgar in our lives. Although most of the reps rolled their eyes and shuddered, the idea itself could not be sniffed at.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t sell wine by the cliché. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the tasting featured 120 wines with a particular focus – the vast majority retailing under £20, made from organically or biodynamically farmed grapes, and in most cases, vinified in a low-intervention style. Affordable gems. And better than Poundland. </span></p>
<h2><b>Kindred Spirits</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-9.48.18-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-11607 aligncenter" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-9.48.18-AM.png" alt="" width="532" height="658" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-9.48.18-AM.png 308w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-9.48.18-AM-243x300.png 243w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can call spirits from the vasty deep<br />
</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glendower ~ Henry IV, Part 1</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spirituous kindred folk in this case being Caroline Rozes (Domaine d’Aurensan); Laurent Cazottes (Maison Distillerie Cazottes); Barney Wilzak (Capreolus Distillery) and Jean-Luc Josse (Vinmouth) who came to Brawn in London to demonstrate the sheer quality and versatility of their spirits, how they can be an active infusive element in cocktails, and finally, during dinner, how they might perform when matched to certain dishes. We wanted sommeliers, bar managers and chefs to taste the purity and complexity of these elixirs and to think about ways to bring them into their wine, cocktail and food menus.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-9.49.56-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-11608 aligncenter" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-9.49.56-AM.png" alt="" width="531" height="658" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-9.49.56-AM.png 490w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-9.49.56-AM-242x300.png 242w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>(Our First Ever) Champagne x Burgundy Tasting</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cinders, you shall go to the ball. Our Champagne selection has grown considerably over the last couple of years, and we are justifiably proud of the quality of these wines. Burgundy was the obvious dancing partner to bolster the tasting. Five producers came to London (the tasting and wine dinner were held in Wild By Tart in Belgravia) to pour and talk about their wines. We opened some special wines too, which points to one of the major benefits of a focused trade tasting, that a single sample may be tasted by up to 40 customers.</span></p>

<h2><b>The Wines of Settentrione </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The counterpart of our Southern Italian and the Islands tasting a couple of years ago called Mezzogiorno, this was our deep dive into the wines of the northern and central regions. Ok, I am taking a liberty with Lazio! Six producers attended and a line-up stacked with quality. From Barbera to Barolo, from Slarina to Sangiovese, from Valpolicellas of Veneto to the Vitovskas from Carso this was a Giro of the north, a wine tour de force.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reputation can refer to renown (widespread fame) or esteem (the regard in which something is held). It is something that feeds on itself and grows larger until such time as the next big </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes along. A wine becomes popular when it is generally deemed to have a good reputation although the means by which this is acquired may differ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perceived rarity and desirability contribute enormously to the popularity of certain wines, the aura of mystery being a lucrative asset in this regard. Such wines may end up as commodities traded on the grey market or commanding exalted prices at auction. However good they are (and many such wines may be vastly overrated), they become prestige products bought to augment the cellars of wealthy private clients or flipped for a quick profit. When customers see these wines on restaurant wine lists, they may naturally presume that the lofty price is merited and even if they cannot afford to buy the particular wine, will still aspire to buy it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some certainties have disappeared. The rankings or scores (sometimes known as Parkerisation) associated with giving wines their high reputation are less important now. Individuals are just as likely to listen to the recommendation of a friend or look online for information on a wine as to be influenced by a mark out of one hundred. Perhaps, also, the wines designed to impress critics and accrue high scores as a result, are not so much in fashion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these straitened times when so many wines are priced out of the pockets of consumers, perceived value-for-money will help to make a wine more popular. When a particular wine is qualitatively better than others at a similar price point and obviously overdelivers, it gains a loyal audience who are often searching for a “house wine” that they can buy again and again knowing they are getting an excellent deal. The wine may be commercial in style or utterly distinctive, an appellation or a table wine, it is that when a customer drinks it, they appreciate its undoubted value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Value-for-money may be one benchmark of wine popularity. Conversely,  wines that are highly reputed and reassuringly expensive are often considered must-haves, if a wine list is deemed to tick all the boxes. Such wines garner their reputations over time and are collectively rated by critics, journalists, influencers, restaurateurs and sommeliers until such a time as they become iconic in their own right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charismatic or larger-than-life producers with interesting stories to tell or persuasive philosophies to expound are the ambassadors for their own brand and also help to raise awareness of the region in which they are making wine.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wines become popular often for the simple reason that their time has come. Trends happen because people want them to happen. Each country has had its day in the sun.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The label – alas -matters. Responses to label designs are, of course, highly subjective, yet they can help to sell the wine. In some cases, the label may transcend the humble contents within the bottle. Conversely, an unassuming or dreary label can affect the sales of a superb wine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising is overrated as a means of popularising wines, but social media plays a significant role as does simple word of mouth. The actions of wine merchants have more power than one thinks. Many years ago I made a conscious effort to sell more Muscadet by putting samples in every customer tasting and suggesting that this appellation was the new Chablis and the next big thing. This was a self-fulfilling prophecy – we tripled our sales of Muscadet in that year alone, and a few months later I was invited to attend a round table wine magazine discussion to assess why Muscadet had suddenly taken off so remarkably in the trade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t take credit for the irresistible rise of Muscadet. Wines become popular often for the simple reason that their time has come. Trends happen because people want them to happen. Talking about the next big thing is not enough in itself. Getting hard listings so that consumers see the wines wherever they go, persuading the trade to talk about their new best-selling wines – these are the concrete measures required to make a wine really popular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tastes change with the generations. For a start, more people drink wine than ever and across the socio-economic classes. When I was first introduced to wine,  choice was limited, and hierarchies were apparent. You had the classics (cru classé Bordeaux, Burgundy from famous estate, the wines of Piedmont and Tuscany, Californians, German Riesling and so on) and you had supermarket wine. After this came the vogue for all things New World and varietal, from plump Aussie Chardonnay and Shiraz, New Zealand Sauvignon and later on Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon and Argentinean Malbec. Each country has had its day in the sun. Reputation is dependent on PR and getting wines in front of influencers (be they bloggers, journalists or wine educators).  A lot of money is spent by wine organisations to secure influence. Yet with all this PR clamour, no single voice stands out. When every grape variety seems to have its own day in the calendar, when articles on every region in the wine world are being published regularly (proclaiming that they are the next big thing), the nature of popularity itself becomes more transient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popularity might be measured in brute sales and sheer growth, but these are dependent on how major markets across the world are performing at a given time, which in turn are dependent on tariffs, taxes and other trade barriers.  If for some reason, high tariffs say, a market effectively shuts down, it does not mean that the wines have become less popular, rather that they have become artificially less affordable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers should taste a wine on its merits and without reference to its reputation. Just because a wine may be popular does not mean that it is good. Or even that you have to like it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular singing has a highly valued place in Georgian culture. Polyphonic singing, in the Georgian language, is a secular tradition in a country whose language and culture have often been oppressed by invaders. There are three types of polyphony in Georgia: complex polyphony, which is common in Svaneti; polyphonic dialogue over a bass background, prevalent in the Kakheti region in Eastern Georgia; and contrasted polyphony with three partially improvised sung parts, characteristic of western Georgia. The Chakrulo song, which is sung at ceremonies and festivals and belongs to the first category, is distinguished by its use of metaphor and its yodel, the krimanchuli and a “cockerel&#8217;s crow”, performed by a male falsetto singer. Some of these songs are linked to the cult of the grapevine and many date back to the eighth century.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many wines are blends of disparate grape varieties which come together as one in the final wine. Nowhere is more evident than in the Pheasant’s Tears Poliphonia</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the untrained ear, polyphonic folk singing may sound strangely discordant. But then so might the monophonic unaccompanied Gregorian chant whose repetitions often induce a meditative, even trance-like state. In polyphony, because it is technically different, one might initially search in vain for modern melodies and mellifluousness, but soon the overall sound becomes the seamless amalgam of the different voices, and one begins to anticipate the intervals and slide into the internal rhythm of the song.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_5838" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5838" style="width: 323px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-31-at-10.02.19-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-5838" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-31-at-10.02.19-AM.png" alt="" width="323" height="520" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-31-at-10.02.19-AM.png 592w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-31-at-10.02.19-AM-186x300.png 186w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5838" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Pheasant&#8217;s Tears Poliphonia</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many wines are blends of disparate grape varieties (or vineyards, or terroirs) which come together as one in the final wine. Nowhere is more evident than in the Pheasant’s Tears Poliphonia which contains perhaps 117 different Georgian varieties with a further 40 yet to be identified. When harvested, the grapes are a melange of different colours; their skins may be green, yellow, gold, orange, purple, rose-hued. All are straight pressed regardless and go into the final mix. The visual result is an appealingly orange/pinkish hazy wine with a delicious unique flavour identity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poliphonia is one (extreme) example of the so-called field blend, often red and white grape varieties planted together, harvested together and fermented together. A kind of wine harmony emerges, something greater than the sum of the discrete parts, at the same time nuanced in that it honours those different elements. Just like when the different voices come together (in one’s perception) to create the polyphonic song.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus Poliphonia can be seen as unity forged out of apparent chaos with the difference between all these many and varied grapes washing into the wholesome whole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its name is emblematic of a greater truth. Living in a city like London, one may witness the rich variety that people from different cultures give to the city, bringing their stories, their language, their art, their music and their culinary traditions with them from other countries. Each individual adds something different to the colour palette. In the end, we are a mixture of our genetic origins and our specific traditions but have the opportunity to absorb those of others and renew our worldview in the process. Those who complain about cultural dilution ignore thousands of years of our history of inclusiveness, wherein individuals from all over the world have come to work and live and contribute to the energy of this great city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poliphonia, the wine, is a valuable archive of many forgotten grape varieties. As a wine with colour (and yet without a definable colour), with flavours (yet without a single obvious one to pin down), it conveys the shifting tonal notes and subtle energetic inflections of a multi (multi) blend. Such a wine reminds us that life can be more complex than black or white (or, in wine terms, red and white or even red, white and/or orange!), and that the real truth of the matter is what we receive as part of our experience and how we perceive it. Suddenly, the different seemingly discordant voices come together, and the song is heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting down at Georgian supra the other day, at a table laden with lovingly crafted dishes vibrating with colour and diverse ingredients, the orange (for want of a better descriptive colour) wine glinting in the glass, I felt that this wine, diversity incarnate, at this moment, was specifically designed for the food and the different guests each with their unique experiences. As if the wine symbolised the social bonding that occurs when friends – and indeed strangers – sit down together around a table, the time when individuals become as one family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Les Caves de Pyrene, we were one of the first companies to explore Georgia’s rich wine culture. We began to ship a handful of wines from this country in 2011, and now work with no fewer than 17 producers and nearly fifty wines. Over the years, we have hosted numerous supras (banquets) and held trade tastings focused exclusively on these wines. We hold Georgia and her artisan winemakers in deep regard.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Les Caves doesn’t do Champagne and Burgundy tastings until they do. And so it came to pass with our inaugural punt into these regions on Monday October 13</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at London&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wildbytart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild By Tart</a>. This tasting arose out of our desire to exhibit our increasing portfolio of small champagne producers, that region where we have hitherto been a very poor relation. Now we are very confident about the quality of these artisan vignerons from Champagne and wanted to show also the sheer variety of styles, connected by the fact these guys are not just making bubbles qua bubbles, they are making gastronomic wines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little word about dosage. Only one of the wines listed below has a dosage of above 4g/l, in other words, all the others are either extra brut or brut nature. To be able to achieve this, you require excellent ripe grapes, otherwise the champagne will taste acidic. Although conventional champagne is largely based on blending to a house style, it is instructive to taste wines that are vinified by parcel or where the grape variety takes centre stage (Taillet for Meunier; Vauversin for Chardonnay; Marie-Courtin for Pinot Noir) and we can sense clearly the origin of the grapes.</span></p>
<h2><b>Maxime Blin, Trigny</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 12-hectares of vines are exclusively planted in the village of Trigny, making the champagnes from the estate ‘mono-crus’ or single-village wines, very rare in the Champagne region. They became ‘vignerons independents’ in 1988 under the impetus of Gilles, Maxime&#8217;s father. Maxime returned to the estate in 2005, followed by his wife Claire in 2013. They opted to go down the organic route in 2018, and the vineyard has been certified organic since 2021 with first organic wine arriving in 2022. Dosage is low – around extra brut level, and the entry level Carte Blanche is bottled Brut Nature.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maxime-Blin-Champagne-Carte-Blanche-NL.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-11576 aligncenter" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maxime-Blin-Champagne-Carte-Blanche-NL.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="754" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maxime-Blin-Champagne-Carte-Blanche-NL.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maxime-Blin-Champagne-Carte-Blanche-NL-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maxime-Blin-Champagne-Carte-Blanche-NL-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NV Carte Blanche Brut Nature ~ 80% Pinot Meunier, 20% Pinot Noir</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NV Grande Tradition Extra Brut ~ 90% Chardonnay, 10% Pinot Noir</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2012 Ailes de Psyché Extra Brut ~ 100% Pinot Noir</span></p>
<h2><b>Jean-Paul Deville, Verzenay</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 1969, Jean-Paul Deville is a family owned and run estate in Champagne. They own most of their vineyards (around 20 hectares) but buy in a small amount of grapes from growers under contract. Their vineyards are situated throughout the Champagne region with some in the Cotes des Blancs (Chardonnay vines on limestone and chalk) whilst the Pinot Noir vines are on clay-limestone. The wines are now made by Marie-Alice Deville, and the vineyards are farmed organically (with certification).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NV Carte Noire Brut  ~ 75% Pinot Noir, 20% Chardonnay, 5% Pinot Meunier</span></p>
<h2><b>Hugues Godmé, Verzenay &amp; Verzy</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hugues is the fifth generation to grow champagne in Verzenay. He has provided 40 years of technical knowledge necessary for the management of the vineyards and the development of their wines. He owns 11 hectares, 40 plots of vines spread over four villages of the Montagne de Reims: Verzenay, Verzy, Villers-Marmery and Villedommange . Since 2006, they began farming organically (certified in 2013) then biodynamically (certified in 2014). For Godmé, top-quality vineyard work is of utmost importance for later quality in the glass. &#8220;When I see the grapes hanging on the vine, I already know how the champagne will taste later.&#8221; This philosophy allows Godmé to produce Champagnes expressing the subtlety and strength of the terroirs of which they are from. The non-vintage wines have around 50% reserve wine to bolster them. The vintage wines (Les Champs St Martin &amp; Les Alouettes Saint Bets 1er cru) are aged for 96 months sur lattes &#8211; and are sensationally profound.</span></p>

<h2><b>Maurice Delabaye, Damery</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For five generations, the Delabaye family has cultivated vines with dedication and deep respect for the Champagne tradition. Their 10-hectare estate is located in the heart of the Marne Valley, near Épernay, and extends across 10 villages, including parcels classified as Grand Cru and Premier Cru. The estate grows the three classic Champagne grape varieties (Pinot Meunier, Pinot Noir, and Chardonnay) each selected for its unique role in expressing the region’s character. All grapes are pressed on-site, allowing full control over the vinification process. With meticulous blending and time-honoured methods, Delabaye crafts wines that capture the essence of their terroir. Each cuvée is aged in deep cellars at a constant 10°C, where time and silence shape the house’s elegant and distinctive style. All the wines are extra brut or zero dosage.</span></p>

<h2><b>Eric Taillet, Baslieux-sous-Châtillon</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based in Baslieux-sous-Châtillon in the Belval Valley, the domaine is composed of 6 hectares of Meunier for the most part (82%), a little bit of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir and some forgotten varieties like Pinot Gris, Petit Meslier and Arbane. Eric jokes he was baptised in Champagne and that he became a winemaker as a result. Founded in 1956, Champagne Taillet marketed its first bottled in 1961. Eric (fourth generation) took over the domaine in 1995 with modern and sustainable ideas while using a lot of manual work. His winemaking philosophy is a little different from what is usually done in the area. He is inspired by a certain phrase &#8220;Meunier, tu dors” (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">meunier</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you sleep) meaning you must leave it alone. The less one intervenes, the better it will express itself. Most of their cuvees are made from Meunier only. Today, Eric works alongside his children Dylan and Léna Taillet. Progressive organic and biodynamic work in the vines assists healthy grape production and low intervention winemaking carries on the good work. Dosage is low, ranging from 1 g/.l to 2.5 g/l.</span></p>

<h2><b>Laurent Vauversin, Oger, Côtes des Blancs</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maison Vauversin, currently managed by Laurent Vauversin and his father Bruno, has existed since the 17th century. In 1640, Nicolas de Vauversin was the first to plant vines in the little village of Oger (near the town of Épernay), on the Côtes des Blancs. Fifteen generations succeeded him. In 1930, Bruno’s grandfather Fernand Vauversin, became a pioneer: he stopped selling his grapes to local merchants and decided to commercialize his own champagne.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laurent loves his vineyard above all, not as a production site but as a complete ecosystem he needs to protect, with its rhythm, its biodiversity, its soul… The entire estate was consequently switched to organic winemaking in 2011. He wants to create the best possible and most sensible transition, between preserving centuries of experience and new, contemporary impulses and visions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The winery received certification in 2014, making it the first organic house in Oger. Biodiversity in the vineyard has been particularly important to Vauversin. The vineyard plots are enriched with diversified seedlings (cereals, legumes, flowers, etc.), more perennial plantations of aromatics (lavender, rosemary, sage, etc.) and various different types of tree. Laurent believes that when a positive energy is cultivated in the soil and the vines, it is carried over to the people who enjoy his champagnes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All champagnes are vinified with native yeasts at ambient temperatures and are not filtered. They contain very little sulphur (less than 35mg/l). The riddling takes place by hand in the natural cellar. All the wines are extra brut; some are zero dosage. Beautiful expressions of the chalky soils of the Côtes des Blancs, capable of long-ageing whilst being delicate and even ethereal.</span></p>

<h2><b>Thomas De Marne, Domaine des Cotannes, Ville-sur-Arce, Côte des Bar</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Champagne Thomas de Marne, a small family-run organic estate and successor to Champagne Val Frison, is nestled in the south of Champagne Ardenne, in the renowned Côte des Bar region. Valérie Frison took over her family’s vines in the village of Ville-sur-Arce in 1997, initially selling the grapes to the local cooperative. Together with her then husband, Thierry de Marne, she began converting her vineyards to organic viticulture in 2003, and in 2007, the first vintage eligible for organic certification, they began to make small quantities of their own champagne. In 2018, her son Thomas de Marne and his partner Florie Pilares returned to begin the process of taking over the estate. By the 2020 harvest, they had taken full control. Their goal is to produce wines with as close to zero additions (sulphur, sugar, enzymes, etc.) as possible. Here, their passion for organic viticulture is reflected in every bottle of champagne they produce. The wines made from grapes grown on Kimmeridgean clay are rich and intense (Pinot Noir is their speciality) and all are bottled brut nature (i.e. without dosage). These are mainly single vintage wines; all aged in Burgundian oak barrels with a limited period </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sur lattes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2><b>Maurice Choppin, Damery</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located in Damery, just a few kilometres from Épernay, Maison Maurice Choppin has been working the unique terroirs of the Marne Valley for more than 7 generations. Proud of his family heritage and his humble approach to living things, Benjamin Choppin makes natural and distinctive wines that are powerful, well rounded and balanced. Inspired by the &#8220;Belle Champagne&#8221;, he values its exceptional heritage and shines the light on the work of the winemaker. Chardonnay thrives here on the calcareous soils, and the wines are all bottled extra brut (around 3 g/l).</span></p>

<h2><b>Marie-Courtin, Polisot, Côte des Bar</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominique Moreau was born and bought up in the champagne region. She explains that there, everyone had a piece of land and also vines- it was the norm. Her great-grandmother, Marie Courtin, farmed her land herself, using a horse during the First World War while the menfolk were away on the front. Dominique’s estate is located on land that has always been owned by her family, but they had rented it out to tenant farmers. From the age of eighteen years-old she was working on the land amongst vines. She worked part-time as a teacher in a professional viticulture school and spent the hours when she was not teaching, farming vines. She took over the family estate in 2000 when the previous tenant farmers retired. She began converting her vines to organic farming in 2005. Pinot Noir flourishes on the Kimmeridgean marls, although she has some Chardonnay and Pinot Blanc also. Most of the wines are brut nature and v little added sulphites – Concordance is zero added. The wines are named after emotions and energies.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re here! (Poltergeist)</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To whet your thirst, the following newbies are on order now, nestled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in LCB and awaiting your surprise and delight:</span></p>
<h1><b>Beulah Violetta, Umbria</b></h1>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beulah, peel me a grape (Mae West, I’m No Angel)</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.beulahviolettavineyard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beulah Violetta</a> may sound like a character from Gone With The Wind, but in (wine) reality is a biodynamic farm and vineyard established in early 2022 by Annie Conley, chef and food/travel writer, and James Hird, an award-winning sommelier and one of the co-founders of Rootstock, the legendary natural wine in Sydney. After years of searching across Europe (including Beaujolais, Tuscany, and Piedmont) they found their ideal site near the hilltop town of Todi in Umbria, drawn by its elevation, soils, and wild, untouched surroundings. Named after their grandmothers (Beulah and Violet), the property now has 10.5 hectares under vine, planted with Sangiovese, Ciliegiolo, Trebbiano, Trebbiano Spoletino, and Merlot, with Sagrantino replanted to Ciliegiolo in 2025.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/James-and-Annie_Beulah-violetta.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-11566 aligncenter" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/James-and-Annie_Beulah-violetta.jpg" alt="" width="464" height="696" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/James-and-Annie_Beulah-violetta.jpg 450w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/James-and-Annie_Beulah-violetta-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vineyards, facing east and north east, sit at 450 to 550 metres above sea level, mainly on clay soils with some limestone. The elevation, natural cooling, and steady winds help keep the vines healthy and reduce the risk of disease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The older vines are dry-farmed, and while irrigation exists for new plantings, it has never been used thanks to the site’s moisture-retentive soils and use of cover crops. Yields typically range from 3 to 5 tonnes of fruit per hectare. Around 4.3 hectares were in production in 2023, increasing annually with no further plantings planned. The farm also produces wheat for pasta, olives for oil, and is home to 15 chickens and 15 beehives. Since its purchase, the entire property has been in conversion to biodynamic viticulture, with a commitment to low-intervention, regenerative farming that reflects the unique microclimate and character of the site.<a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/StessoStesso_Front1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11567 aligncenter" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/StessoStesso_Front1.png" alt="" width="643" height="454" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/StessoStesso_Front1.png 1202w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/StessoStesso_Front1-300x212.png 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/StessoStesso_Front1-1024x723.png 1024w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/StessoStesso_Front1-768x542.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blend of the Stesso Stesso is 60% Sangiovese, 30% Merlot, 10% Sagrantino. Grapes are harvested by hand and whole bunches undergo a three-day carbonic maceration, are pressed into stainless tanks, co-fermented, and further matured for 6 months before bottling without filtration, fining and less than 20 ppm of sulphites added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stesso Stesso, meaning &#8220;same same,&#8221; reflects the consistent philosophy behind the wine’s production: minimal intervention, handpicked fruit, and a focus on expressing the unique vineyard site. It’s a playful nod to doing things the same way across vintages while still learning and evolving with the land.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Light and ethereal red with freshness at the fore with some Italian rustic sanguineness too with wild bramble fruit, wild herbs, baking spice lurking in the depths. Think Italian Beaujolais still in touch with its wilder side. A heartfelt red from the heart of Italy.</span></p>

<h1><b>Ansitz Dornach, Alto-Adige</b></h1>
<p><em>Re-habbing A-A, or <span style="font-weight: 400;">new beauties in Süd-Tirol</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once upon a time, o best beloved, we cornered the market in Alto-Adige. If there was a legend, we snaffled it. Our list was littered with great names: Georg Ramoser, Tenuta Falkenstein, Peter Pliger, Bruno Gottardi, Castel Juval, Köfererhof, Cantina Valle Isarco, amongst others. Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there were none. How the Dolo-mighty had fallen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, having screwed our courage to the sticking point, we are back with <a href="https://www.ansitzdornach.it/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ansitz Dornach</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In</span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">1836 Anton von Gelmini zu Kreuzhof purchased Dornach. It was his son Max, afterwards who moulded the estate into its current shape with single terraced vineyards parted by dry walls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 170 years later, Patrich Uccelli took over the small plots of land in Dornach from his mother, began overseeing the vineyards, leaning into biodynamics and becoming one of the first members of Alois Lageder&#8217;s co-operative. He has been bottling his own wines following his notion of “sustainable” wines for around ten years, creating a farm that is as self-sufficient as possible. The location above the village of Salorno, a particularly cool and windy area at the bottom of Alto Adige, favours slow and balanced maturation for the grapes. Meanwhile, everything in the winery is done with as little intervention as possible in order to keep the wines as lifted and drinkable as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The true embodiment of living in harmony with nature can be found at Dornach. The ideals of biodynamics are beautifully rendered here where grapes, other fruits, vegetables, grains, bees and livestock all exist harmoniously creating a closed ecosystem with amazing biodiversity. Patrick is accompanied in this endeavour by his wife, Karoline, and their two children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wines burst with varietal and regional character, pure expressions of site and personality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louis Pinot Grigio is a macerated white wine from a very mineral area at 400 meters above sea level, rich in porphyry, an extrusive volcanic rock (also known as rhyolite). Harvest is manual with spontaneous fermentation in steel from indigenous yeasts and whole bunch maceration for a few days. Ageing takes place in cement and lasts a few months before bottling. The nose recalls summer fruits, yellow peach and apricot, flowers and acacia honey, and after a few minutes vegetal notes tending towards balsamic and oriental spices emerge. In the mouth the wine is full and enveloping, with light yet velvety tannins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinot Blanc/Bianco needs complex soils, perfect sun exposure and a good breeze. Dornach, sitting at an elevation of 350 metres, is perfectly positioned to grow world class Pinot Blanc, and the farm’s embrace of the natural world and deft touch in the cellar creates a wine with intense, crystalline personality and passion. This cuvee blends Chardonnay (40%) for lovely added texture and complexity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Traminer Aromatico is fermented and aged in large acacia barrels. Its multifaceted nose leans decisively toward oriental spices, cloves, and even nutmeg, followed by tropical fruit and hints of acacia, interspersed with flowers and honey. On the palate, it is light and drinkable, dry, and dynamic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stunner, Dornach&#8217;s alpine Pinot Noir exudes pleasure and personality. The grapes come from a vineyard located at 400-metres above sea level. The harvest is manual; the spontaneous fermentation takes place with indigenous yeasts with maceration for a few days and ageing occurs for a few months in large barrels. Elegant and lovely with notes of strawberries, rhubarb and summer berries. Not unserious, but so so drinkable. </span></p>

<h1><b>Distillerie Cazottes, Southwest France</b></h1>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sweet taste of bitterness</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vermouth has as many recipes as there are Italian families. Worse, it has made its mark on the Iberian Peninsula, where each &#8220;vermuteria&#8221; has its own. What were we going to enter into the competition, from the depths of the Tarn?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cazottes2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-5322 aligncenter" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cazottes2.jpg" alt="" width="611" height="611" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cazottes2.jpg 1181w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cazottes2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cazottes2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cazottes2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cazottes2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But yes! This bitter vermouth from none other than <a href="https://www.distillerie-cazottes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laurent Cazottes</a> is designed to be &#8220;bitter&#8221;, because it has to quench thirst, make one salivate, and reach for the bottle again. Gone is the sugar that cloys and clogs the palate: only 35g remains, for a &#8220;dry&#8221; impression and to enhance the strong aromatic. The bartender in one  will cry Martini, Manhattan, Rob Roy, Negroni! The vermouth is a true cocktail creature, but is of course perfectly enjoyed straight, on ice, with a dash of lemon zest thrown in, faux neglect oblige. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fortified wine incorporates Aubrac gentian roots, cinchona, cinnamon and liquorice bark, savoury flowers, caraway seeds, sage, tonka beans&#8230; the result is a little bomb of aromatic bitterness (cue The Verve’s Bittersweet Symphony)!</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nose opens to the Orient, between ginger, camphor, and eucalyptus. Then we enter the old shaman&#8217;s office, we run across the moors, we smell the blond leather of the horse&#8217;s saddle, the fragrant tobacco, the wax and the heather honey. A stick of liquorice, a sloe picked at the edge of the fields, the chiffchaff crushed under the hoof, the smoke of the cade bush that fades after having warmed us&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A journey, yes, but also a skill: 24 months of ageing in old barrels, outdoors, subject to the vagaries of the weather. Then summer &amp; autumn in a glass (or two).</span></p>

It’s not a case of just singing along, it’s listening. It can be one note and that transports you somewhere. And I think if you can conjure up experiences and stories in your mind where the music takes you, to me that’s psychedelic.

<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8876.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11557" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8876.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="583" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8876.jpg 468w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8876-241x300.jpg 241w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wine is life. Rather it is part of life, life being family and community and even the food that one grows and consumes, according to <a href="https://www.andert-wein.at/en/">Michael Andert</a> who I visited, along with his brother Eric, in Austria last month. Michael&#8217;s definition of biodynamics is an equally all-embracing one, stating that it is natural for him to be natural (in the sense of understanding Nature and preserving her rhythms in his life and in his wines). And when you taste the wines, you understand they come from the particular person, their combined philosophy and actions, and finally the place itself &#8211; a message reinforced by a visit to and stroll through the vineyard and garden at Lerchenfeld, sampling the bounty from the ground, the bushes, and plants. Tasting nature at first hand. Then you taste the wines and truly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where they come from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, I have become less interested in the minutiae of wine production or forecasting what will be trendy next year, and more fixated on the actuality of the wine in the glass and how it makes me feel. I know less about wine than I used to, my professional detachment and scientific curiosity have diminished as my desire for simple (used advisedly) gratification increases. Like Michael Andert (and Andreas Tscheppe&#8211;see below) I am comfortable in following my instincts. In my case, I would rather not be encumbered with detailed knowledge as I feel that gets in the way of my tasting empathetically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is probably down to part laziness, part also the creeping realisation that for all the knowledge one may accrue about a wine – from digging into its vineyard origins to analysing its molecular make up – the major variable in any tasting experience is the human one. The fallible human, responsive to nuance one day, oblivious to it the next. The wine is thus not just what it is in a material sense, the object to be apprehended and evaluated for its quality &#8211; it is also the diary of my shifting moods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe not knowing too much about the wine makes me feel that I am approaching the act of tasting it in a fresher state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I say that I don’t like a particular wine, it is probably because its flavours disconcert my momentary preference for (a certain kind of) balance. This is not an absolute judgement on the wine in question, more recognition that my personal taste increasingly dominates my professional judgement. Some wines you get, because they align with your particular taste sensibilities and needs at a given moment, others you can appreciate without loving. I would rather love than appreciate. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fallible human, responsive to nuance one day, oblivious to it the next. The wine is thus not just what it is in a material sense &#8211; the object to be apprehended and evaluated for its quality &#8211; it is also the diary of my shifting moods.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tastes can change.  I used to adore the aromas and flavours of decay in wines (earthy, mulchy, mushroominess), much as back then I preferred the warm russet colours of autumn, my favourite season. Now I favour the gush of the new vintage, the explosion of precocious fruit, minerals, energy and life, just as now I love the exuberance of spring.  If I can change my allegiance to the seasons, then surely I can change my wine preferences!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tasting is also, of course, the right time meets the right environment and that helps to create the right (responsive) mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Andert wines, I felt the nourishing aspect of a natural product made without anything added. Of liquid energy warming my body. Of completion. And to drink thoughtlessly, just like eating the raw veg dug from the soil or the berry plucked from a bush. Absolved from judging, one is momentarily restored to a state of uncultured appreciation.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8878.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11558" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8878.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="582" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8878.jpg 468w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8878-241x300.jpg 241w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, we visit <a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/2018/06/13/doug-decants-the-wines-of-andreas-tscheppe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andreas Tscheppe</a>. The wines are different, but similar emotions are engendered. When one tastes the wines, you sense the profound connection to a particular vineyard. You visit the vineyard, and you are looped back to the wine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When communicated, he passion of the growers is key to an enhanced experience. They are not trying to impress you or forcing their opinions on you but simply describing what they think and do. For Michael, his love for the vineyard and the garden is primal. And there is a deep respect too. Andreas is the vibrating human link in the chain, theorising, tinkering, inventing, experimenting and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">doing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This dancing energy is evident in the fabric of his wines.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8879.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11559" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8879.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="596" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8879.jpg 468w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8879-242x300.jpg 242w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reminds me of Goethe’s Faust, wherein Faust is translating the famous passage from The Gospel According to John.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Tis written: “In the beginning was the Word!”<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here now I&#8217;m balked! Who&#8217;ll put me in accord?<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is impossible, the Word so high to prize,<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I must translate it otherwise<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I am rightly by the Spirit taught.<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Tis written: In the beginning was the Thought!<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider well that line, the first you see,<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That your pen may not write too hastily!<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it then Thought that works, creative, hour by hour?<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus should it stand: In the beginning was the Power!<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet even while I write this word, I falter,<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For something warns me, this too I shall alter.<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spirit&#8217;s helping me! I see now what I need<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And write assured: In the beginning was the Deed!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Andreas (and Michael) the wines are as by-products of their happy existence in Nature, as well as liquid proof of the relationship they enjoy with their vineyards. Tasting and drinking the wines </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in situ</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to be briefly admitted to the family and to be part of the conversations they are having with their environment.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resin not the need, this Savatiano is top of the terps!</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dmitris <a href="http://www.geowines.gr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgas</a> is</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a 4th generation vine grower and winemaker. He took over the family vineyards almost 20 years ago. Since then the vineyards have been certified organic. The 6 ha vineyards are spread throughout the region of Mesogaia (Ancient Greek name Meso =in the middle + Gaia= the land of Attica peninsula (Athens area). Mesogaia is one of the oldest wine regions of Greece, specialising in the indigenous Savatiano white vines, where PGI Attika wines are produced. The dominant features of this dry climate are the gently sloping hills, low rainfall and temperate climate (located between two seas). More locally, there are big olive trees between the vineyards, as well as fig and almond and scrub-like garrigue. Descriptions of viticulture and wines from this region date back to 300 BC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The family vineyard is scattered over twelve small, but discrete parcels on dry clay marls soils. The oldest vines are the dry-farmed Savatiano (50 years +). Biodynamic preparations have been applied in some of the vineyards since 2000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retsina is the catch-all term for resinated wines. The tradition originates in the Attica wine region, where the fresh pine resin of the native old pine trees in Attica (Pinus Halapensis) was introduced into the must of the white Savatiano before fermentation. Retsina and non-resinated Savatiano dry wines had a strong century-long history, being the key player in the local white wines of Athens between 1850-1980.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grapes are harvested by hand at a pitifully small yield of 4.5 hl/ha, are destemmed and undergo a five-day cold maceration on the skins in tank which imbues the juice with its deep amber colour. The must is then pressed, and fermentation proceeds with native yeasts. The fresh resin, collected from local Aleppo pines in late summer, is added to the fresh must before fermentation and stays there until the first racking (2-3 months).</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Premium quality Retsina carries the characteristic balsamic aroma of pine which, however, does not inhibit grape aromas. The imperceptible sense of bitterness leaves a refreshing aftertaste and makes Retsina the ideal companion of the flavourful dishes of traditional Greek cuisine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no barrel ageing. Retsina is best fresh; it takes about a couple of months after bottling to begin to develop the secondary lemony aromas and also to soften the tannins. The malolactic occurs in the bottle. No sulphur is added to this wine as the inherent preservative properties of the resin serve to protect the juice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The colour and the flavours are intriguing. The wine has a hazy amber hue, care of the skin contact, sports aromas of dried lemon, warm apricot skin, roasted spice, and gives a dry, warm, spicy sensation in the mouth, hints of balsam, dry honey and a quinine finish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wine goes with Greek mezze – small pieces of different foods such as deep-fried fish or meat, feta cheese and Greek salad. The complexity, the pine resin, and the good level of acidity of this wine due to its vinification with traditional wine-making techniques make it a good accompaniment to the richer dishes of Greek cuisine, as especially barbecued and roasted meats.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/49.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11548" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/49.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="646" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/49.jpg 983w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/49-300x210.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/49-768x538.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have “semi-Retsina”. (I have invented a new category). Well, it is a wine made using the methods above but from a different region to Attica. Nimbus Ritinitis from Kamara in Thessaloniki in the north-east of the country, is 100% Assyrtiko. The skins of Assyrtiko are macerated in stainless steel tanks with the must for 8-10 days at low temperature. After removal of the pomace, the must produced by the free-run juice ferments at 18º- 21º C for 20-30 days. During this fermentation, high quality pine resin from the mountains of Evia is added, following an ancient recipe. Spontaneous alcoholic fermentation takes place with indigenous yeasts, with no oenological substances added, followed by spontaneous malolactic fermentation. The wine is racked from the very dense sediments and remains sur-lie on fine lees for three months. No protein stabilization, only tartaric stabilization. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Kamara-Nimbus-Ritinitis-Orange-Retsina.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-11551" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Kamara-Nimbus-Ritinitis-Orange-Retsina.jpg" alt="" width="353" height="881" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Kamara-Nimbus-Ritinitis-Orange-Retsina.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Kamara-Nimbus-Ritinitis-Orange-Retsina-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Kamara-Nimbus-Ritinitis-Orange-Retsina-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nimbus Ritinitis has distinct herbal and vegetal notes on the palate, with an intense expression of bergamot and kumquat along with resin, thyme and eucalyptus. Balanced acidity with fruit and herbs is apparent in the long lasting aftertaste.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">…When you learn of this fino not from Jerez</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RWF24-Prof.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11542" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RWF24-Prof.jpg" alt="" width="925" height="617" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RWF24-Prof.jpg 1012w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RWF24-Prof-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RWF24-Prof-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not from Jerez, and it is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palomino, yet here we have a refreshing dry non-fortified </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fino</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to crisp up the edges of your tongue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 1729, Alvear is not only the oldest winery in Montilla, but in all of Andalucia. The family-owned company has been around for almost three centuries, making it the third-oldest family run winery in Spain and its brand C.B. the fifth oldest in the country. The winery has maintained its artisanal approach over time, staying true to its principles and philosophy as it grew. Today the stewardship of the winery lies with the eighth generation of the family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as respecters of tradition, they are innovators also, and the Tres Miradas range of equally non-sticky PX wines, showcases a variety of albariza climates, soils and expositions, revealing how this grape, when tended carefully, can express the particularities of its terroir.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The family-owned company has been around for almost three centuries, making it the third-oldest family run winery in Spain and its brand C.B. the fifth oldest in the country.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The climate might be described as Mediterranean/continental with some key microclimates specific to the Sierra de Montilla (i.e. cooler, and more humid than surrounding areas). We are about 30 minutes’ drive south of the city of Córdoba here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The albariza soils with a high calcareous content in the subzones of RioFrio Alto and Cerro Macho imbue the wines with a distinct chalky inflection, whilst also contributing to their excellent acidity. The Fino itself comes from the aforementioned organically-grown 100% Pedro Ximenez  &#8211; which this region is renowned for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand-harvested grapes are de-stemmed, direct-pressed into stainless vats and fermented at cool temperatures with indigenous yeasts.  The wine is then matured in botas (6000-litre American oak barrels) on the lees and bottled without stabilisation, filtering or fining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Golden straw in colour, the nose displays those classic yeasty characteristics &#8211; breadcrumbs, hay with oxidative elements &#8211; ripe apple, almond, exotic spice. Very elegant, saline, very dry.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">En Rama</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> translates from Spanish as &#8216;on the branch&#8217; i.e. a fruit picked straight from the tree, in its freshest, purest state. This refers to the fact the wine is ‘raw&#8217;: straight from the cask, unfined and unfiltered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect as an aperitif and with all manner of salty tapas, seafood, shellfish and most starters. Second to none with Japanese food (the wine is umami-tastic)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other zero abv drinks may apply</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for low/zero alcoholic drinks has increased steadily over the last two decades. The primary motivation is driven by health concerns related to overconsumption. There are various alternatives to wine that don’t pretend to be wine &#8211; and that is fine &#8211; but there is also a lot of research going into making wine without alcohol. What’s the secret? Is there one? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a reverse philosopher’s stone, a substance that can transmute fine wine into its base alcohol-free alter ego?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of alcohol directly impacts our tasting experience. Removing it affects the wine’s taste, aroma, and mouthfeel. With alcohol being the most abundant, there are more than a thousand volatile compounds in wine. At higher concentrations (in wine) alcohol may give the simultaneous impressions of sweetness and bitterness. In the mouth, its heat can be detected on the tongue (and in the nose) even in lower levels and contribute to the liquid’s overall mouthfeel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We equate the degree of alcohol present with the so-called body of the wine. Research shows a relation between physical measures of wine viscosity and density, and alcohol content, but there are also other factors involved in what constitutes the perceived body of a wine.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>De-alcoholisation is an avowedly manipulative process</h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing the alcohol content in wine is not as simple as diluting it with water, although there are numerous instances of winemakers adding water to wine to bring it down to an acceptable level. The most common practices are post-fermentation and consist of removing alcohol from a finished wine either through a membrane or by distillation. The challenge for these techniques is to precisely remove the tiny alcohol molecules and nothing else. But aromatic compounds and water are often extracted as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the common effects of alcohol reduction in wine are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decrease in overall persistence in the mouth, as well as heat sensation, texture, sweetness, complexity of aromatics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of de-alcoholisation, an awkward-sounding word in itself, is one of removing or inhibiting. What it leaves is a body without a spirit (literally). Alcohol is the fire in wine and spreads its sensations throughout your being, building flavours and textures. Its headiness conveys a multitude of aromas to our nasal membranes and from there by various pathways to the part of our brains that process information and deal with memories and associations and stimulate pleasure receptors.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chemist-2815640_1280.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11537" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chemist-2815640_1280.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="504" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chemist-2815640_1280.jpg 1280w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chemist-2815640_1280-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chemist-2815640_1280-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chemist-2815640_1280-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wine is a unique drink, the complex result of innumerable farming and winemaking decisions with an element of chance thrown in (the nature of the vintage or the way the ferment goes). Natural and low-intervention wines are less processed (albeit the juice is transformed into wine), whereas denatured, mass-produced wines are made to a formula and intended to be consistent products. Winemaking thus involves a spectrum of approaches and consequent outcomes, rather than a simple either/or.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">De-alcoholisation, however, is an avowedly manipulative process. The key concept here to removing alcohol from wine is that ethanol has a lower boiling point (78°C) than water. So if you heat up the liquid, there will come a point when the alcohol evaporates off, leaving behind a 0% abv drink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply boiling the wine won’t work in itself as the volatile flavour compounds that give wine its taste will be removed. Other methods are normally used, most notably, ‘reverse osmosis’ – the technique of forcing the wine through a membrane at pressure, to separate the (larger) flavour molecules from the smaller water and alcohol ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reverse osmosis is utilised for small decreases in abv. Vacuum distillation (where the boiling points are notably lower than classic distillation) is the approved technique to reach low-to zero-alcohol levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heating wine under pressure at lower temperatures (often known as spinning cone technology) allows for a precise and relatively gentle way of splitting the drink into three elements: the alcohols, the flavour compounds, and water. These are collected separately. The alcohol is sold off and the other two elements blended back together.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">De-alcoholisation is more a matter of copying the basic flavours of what we call wine and is based on the very idea of stripping away a vital component of the wine that will leave it “hollowed out” and replacing it with compensating flavour.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is one more final stage to go through first – and that is ‘rebalancing’. As mentioned, alcohol is an integral component of the wine, transporting flavour and providing mouthfeel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To compensate for this absence, oenologists often add small amounts of flavouring and/or some of the original must (grape juice pre-fermentation). These can help to put back missing flavour compounds and ‘fatten out’ the palate with a little natural sweetness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But every winery will have a different strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does it work? The proof is in the drinking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the aim of the exercise is to produce a wine without alcohol, the process will replace the natural transformations which occur when wine is made. Many vignerons work diligently to grow the best-quality grapes and as sensitively as possible to ensure that the ultimate wine will typically express its origin of microclimate and soil, as well as the nature of the vintage. Vignerons intend their wines to have a unique signature. De-alcoholisation is more a matter of copying the basic flavours of what we call wine and is based on the very idea of stripping away a vital component of the wine that will leave it “hollowed out” and replacing it with compensating flavour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientists will no doubt produce more ingenious technological solutions to rebalance that which is lost when alcohol is removed, but the fundamental question remains: if you love the taste of real wine, why would you bother with a processed copy, no matter how artfully (scientifically) achieved? The way wine is made is what makes it “wine”, by remaking it, it cannot claim to be anything other than a pale shadow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of this is to gainsay non-alcoholic drinks that are made with organic products and by natural fermentation processes. Rather than taking a wine and denaturing it further, a more interesting approach is to create drinks that in terms of sensation and mouthfeel do not leave you wanting a wine. But that is another story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us finally not forget the other essential functions of wine. Great wine (however we define it) can evoke a profound aesthetic response in the taster. Alcohol is the catalyst here. And, more fundamentally, wine is intoxicating. Here, alcohol is essential!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something BAD (sic), something new, and something a bit older (Ed- that’s feeble)</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11529" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto.jpg" alt="" width="786" height="524" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto.jpg 2000w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-1536x1024.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marto Wein is the project of Marto Otto Wörner and Alanna Lagamba who make natural wine in the village of Flonheim, in Rheinhessenn, Germany. Marto took over his father&#8217;s 7 hectares vines in 2017 which has now expanded to 10 hectares. The focus is on wines made from indigenous grape varieties that give a true reflection of the vintage. Alanna hails from Canada and met Marto in a Berlin wine bar.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so to B.A.D.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B.A.D. is short for: BIG ASS DORNFELDER. And here is the cute explanation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiendishly unfashionable Dornfelder is normally a very high yielding and low-in-sugar red variety, one of the first grapes to be harvested to avoid the dreaded suzuki fly. This vineyard, however, is an exception to that rule (at least in 2023). Sat around 300 m high (that’s high for Rheinhessen!), directly next to a church, on an exceptional, exposed site called the Weissberg (white mountain, all limestone), the vineyard soils are composed of Jura-type clay-limestone. This particular section has very little topsoil – meaning extra-tough conditions for the grapes. The Dornfelder was therefore extremely low yielding, and in 2023 there was such a big harvest that Alanna and Martin didn’t think that they would be able to pick properly, so they left the fruit hanging. Lo and behold, at the end of September, Martin happened to check the vines whilst they were harvesting Riesling nearby, and the grapes were still healthy. Being on a south-facing slope and receiving a lot of sun, these grapes had shrivelled into raisins, and they were able to harvest 1200-litre of their BIG ASS DORNFELDER. The name is based on the fact that they didn’t think it would ever be possible to harvest Dornfelder so ripe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grapes were immediately 100% whole bunch pressed without maceration into a used 1200 litre barrel where the juice underwent ambient ferment with native yeasts and continued to age in the same vessel until after malolactic. The wine was bottled with filtration, fining and no sulphites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such colour for a straight presser! Aromas of ripe blackberries, kirsch and bruised black plums, not dissimilar to super-ripe Gamay. Be bad to yourself and try it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-Cote-de-Flon-2023.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11531" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-Cote-de-Flon-2023.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="649" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-Cote-de-Flon-2023.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-Cote-de-Flon-2023-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-Cote-de-Flon-2023-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /></a>If that’s the B.A.D. news, how about good news of a continental coastal blend. Flonheim-by-the-sea? Perhaps a discernible absence of candyfloss and penny arcades (is that a thing still?) and seagulls squawking for your chips, but you can positively inhale the salinity in spades from this here Marto Cote de Flon. The village of Flonheim used to be on the coast in prehistoric times, hence the cheeky nod in the name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another blend, this time of Riesling, Silvaner, Pinot Blanc &amp; Pinot Noir (straight-pressed), By the way,  Alanna and Martin have abandoned red wines for the time being hence white Pinot is making its way into several wines. Whole cluster bunches fed into and fermented in stainless steel and then moved into used 500 litre and 2400 litre barrels to do malo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mouthful of freshness, citrus pith and skin. Perfect with oysters, or on the Cote de Flon, cured river fish.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-Reserve-Pinot-Gris-2022.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11532" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-Reserve-Pinot-Gris-2022.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="651" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-Reserve-Pinot-Gris-2022.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-Reserve-Pinot-Gris-2022-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marto-Reserve-Pinot-Gris-2022-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 261px) 100vw, 261px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there is also the less crazy-crazy and more detailed side of the Marto enterprise. Take their Pinot Gris Reserve (2022 vintage) from a single vineyard rich in limestone. The grapes are whole bunch straight pressed into 1,200 litre used barrels, slowly fermented with their own yeasts, and aged on lees for two years without disturbance. No filtration, no fining, and no sulphites added whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A brilliant wine! More just-ripe pears and apples than full-throttle fleshy fruit and beautiful energy with a seam of limey acidity coursing across the palate.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the song of the terroir drowns out the background noise</span></i></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five years ago, <a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/2020/12/07/doug-decants-vitovska-kamen-zidarich/">I tasted a new addition to the Zidarich portfolio</a>. I was already deeply enamoured with their Vitovska Classica, but as wonderful as that was, the Vitovska Kamen possessed that bit extra, the resonant call of terroir ++.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bring this up as I am already pondering my wines of the year. If I leave this exercise until December, I will inevitably get distracted by other considerations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is unusual about the Kamen is that I did not drink it, as nature surely intended, over a relaxed dinner at home nor in a restaurant with friends. This was poured and tasted amongst jabbing elbows in the noisy tasting hall. I had no tasting sheet or notebook to hand; I simply wanted to have something to toy with in my glass. In other words, my critical receptivity was low-to-zero, and enjoyment, which requires a convivial environment to flourish, was being heavily suppressed by the ambient brouhaha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet. The wine sang lustily. It was utterly wholesome. Effortlessly mineral. A shaft of light held in liquid form. Whatever else might happen, it was decidedly my wine of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Benjamin-Zidarich.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11252" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Benjamin-Zidarich.jpg" alt="" width="518" height="777" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Benjamin-Zidarich.jpg 450w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Benjamin-Zidarich-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Carso is that thin slice of land connecting Trieste to the main mass of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia. Officially speaking, this is Italy, but as is the case all along Italy’s border with Slovenia, the wine culture transcends national boundaries. Winegrowing in the Carso extends well beyond the border into Slovenia (as does winegrowing in the Collio further north), and its trio of peculiar local grapes – the white varieties Vitovska and Malvasia and a strain of the red Refosco known as Terrano/Teran – are uniquely Slavic contributions to the “Italian” viticultural whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heavy limestone content of the soils likely gave the zone its name (Carso is thought to be derived from a Celtic word meaning “land of rock”), and it lends the wines, both white and red, a firm acidic backbone and mouth-watering minerality. On the white side, this means flinty, fragrant accompaniments to fresh seafood in Trieste, Muggia, and other fishing towns along Friuli’s Adriatic basin, while the red Terrano is a high-acid companion to the heartier, Slavic-and-Austrian-inflected food further inland (you’d be surprised how good a tart, tongue-piercing red like Terrano can be as a contrast to the richness of Stinco di Vitello). The Zidarich farm is located in Prepotto, near Duino Aurisina, which is a small and characteristic village of the Carso area. The landscape is extremely varied. The vegetation of the environment is very different and enhances the peculiarity of this territory dedicated to viticulture. Jagged chalky rock is the keynote of Carso viticulture, which is carried out on small terraces of red, iron-rich soil that have been reclaimed from the woodland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Karst is stone shaped by time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the limestone rock dissolved by the water,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the little red earth was born.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seeds of the plants that migrate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from east to west, pushed by the wind,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have left their traces</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in this narrow passage between the sea and the mountains.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man has used what he found</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and managed to cultivate on the stone.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His animals have grazed in every corner.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the barren and inhospitable Karst,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the greenery has returned,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">protected, loved, enjoyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azienda Zidarich was founded in 1988. Benjamin Zidarich revolutionised his father’s company by expanding the vineyards and focusing on native grape varieties, Vitovska, Malvasia and Teran. The Carso area is often affected by the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bora</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cold and violent local wind that can exceed 120 km/h. On the plateau, the climate is fairly continental and benefits from the mild weather that blows up from the Mediterranean Sea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjamin uses a mixture of Guyot and alberello training systems with 4 – 5 buds per plant. The vines are aged between 10 and 35 years old and are planted at a vine density of 8,000 to 10,000 plants per hectare. He has been practising organic for some time and also applies biodynamic treatments to the vineyards. The vineyards are ploughed annually to maintain their health.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjamin Zidarich revolutionised his father’s company by expanding the vineyards and focusing on native grape varieties, Vitovska, Malvasia and Teran.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjamin and family manually harvest the Vitovska grapes in 15 kg crates, usually between late September and early October, and destem them. Fermentation proceeds naturally with indigenous yeasts and no temperature control. With the Kamen, both fermentation and (18-day) maceration occur in stone (KAMEN) vat with daily punchdowns. Kamen means stone. Benjamin has always been fascinated by the natural beauty and unique characteristics of the Carso stone. For many years, he looked for a viable alternative to oak barrels and finally decided to experiment with vinifying in stone vats, a practice that dates back to prehistoric times. Over the last century, similar stone containers were used to preserve various foods, including wine, as they maintain constant temperatures. By creating these stone vats, he also wanted to strengthen the winery’s relationship with the region and terroirs, using a natural material and local artisans. Marko and Kristjan Zidarich were responsible for sculpting the stone into a single vat made of 5 pieces stacked one upon the next.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wine made from stone vats bears witness to a bygone world, to traditions and methods passed down from our grandparents. And so they become a clear and indelible trace of the vine&#8217;s circle, where the grapes grow on vines anchored, with their roots, in the limestone soil, absorbing its essence. During maceration and fermentation, they find themselves in close contact with the same stone from which they grow, finally exuding its flavour in the glass. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Zidarich)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After ferment, the Kamen is left on the fine lees and aged in medium and large Slavonian oak barrels for 20-24 months and bottled without filtration and fining and minimal sulphur addition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Vitovska has a most attractive mid-gold colour, aromas of chamomile, fruit pith and wet limestone, gentle entry in the mouth and initially reserved palate that moves between apricot-stone-fruit, cool minerals, golden spice and savoury-smoky elements. It finishes on a strong bitter phenolic note and medicinal nuances of fennel and wild herbs and spices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is wine that defines or rather describes its terroir. It possesses a driving minerality, the essence of pure stone, capturing both the sunshine of the vineyards and the cool depth of the cellar hewn out of local stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time for wine is a feeling akin to switching off one’s phone (or sloughing off one’s work persona), marking a point in the day when one’s behaviour for a period of time will be determined by the consumption of alcohol (and its effect). Wine time includes the anticipation of uncorking a bottle and feeling the first liquid of the day pass your lips and the moment you utter that sigh to denote the alcohol has hit the spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the wine is more important than a mere catalyst for irreverent inebriation, then time, or rather timing, is one of the more unheralded aspects of tasting and enjoyment. Timing is when the joining moment for you and the wine is as perfect as it ever will be. It is one thing, after all, to crave wine and to believe that it will taste great because that craving is being assuaged (and perhaps the wine will indeed perform that function perfectly), but it is also about recognising that deferring gratification can play a role in the taste of the wine. Tasting wine is not always about diving straight in. The choice of glass, one’s posture even, and a host of little rituals set the scene for appreciation.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wine time includes the anticipation of uncorking a bottle and feeling the first liquid of the day pass your lips and the moment you utter that sigh to denote the alcohol has hit the spot.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing one’s body clock helps in assessing the best time to taste and drink wine. With taste buds unclogged by extraneous flavours, beginning to feel hungry (and therefore thirsty), my palate is usually most acute in mid-morning and towards lunchtime. Because my senses are at their sharpest at this time of day, I am also at my most analytic and judgmental. Which is good for tasting and assessment. I am also conscious that a large portion of the day remains in which work has to be done!  Subconsciously, therefore, I am less willing to submit to the lure of pleasure.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_8856.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8400" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_8856.jpg" alt="" width="569" height="569" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_8856.jpg 750w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_8856-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_8856-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My body clock (here acting as a reward system) also tells me to “feel” that 6.00 pm is when I deserve to enjoy wine as a relaxant. My palate is less sensitive; yet I am more open to pleasure. Drinking wine symbolically is sloughing off the demands of the day. The first hit is usually the best – it cools you down and warms you up at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereafter, tasting enjoyment peaks or plateaus. Above a certain amount, and after a certain time, I become conscious of the effects of alcohol and eventually the pleasure given by a wine (or wine in general) diminishes. Adaptation occurs, followed by palatal exhaustion.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Drinking wine symbolically is sloughing off the demands of the day</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drinking well involves listening to what your mind and body are telling you. Enjoyment of wine is generally diminished for various personal physiological and psychological reasons &#8211; as well as extraneous environmental factors. From your health and mood at a given time, how tired you are to the quality of the light, how noisy the environment is, all these factors combine to shift one’s unconscious impressions of the wine in question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every wine has its own time. A glass of wine contains a complex mixture of chemical compounds, with endlessly shifting aromas and textures. As these slow mutations take place, the wine may become more balanced and more appealing to your palate. Sensing the wine is discovering the moment where there is an alignment between the wine and the taster, wherein the former yields &#8211; and the latter responds. Timing is when one is alert enough to recognise the qualities of the wine and relaxed enough to enjoy the pleasures it affords.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puglian all one’s talents</span></i></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.iparieti.com/en/i-vini/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Parieti</a> was founded in 2019 by Matteo Santoiemma on his family farm in the Murge between Bari, Taranto and Matera. Matteo personally takes care of the vineyards which are planted with both alberello and cordon-trained vines of Primitivo, Verdeca, Minutolo and other indigenous grape varieties. The aim is to preserve varietal character and a sense of place. I Parieti is about three main themes. Stones: the typical dry-stone walls (“Parieti” in dialect) that embrace and protect the vineyards. Family: from both sides, passion, commitment and contradiction strongly intertwine, anchoring the present to the past. And Love: unconsciously cultivated at a tender age and then blooming as an adult, the love towards his land.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vineyard for the Scazzaridde (the name is local dialect meaning little whirlwind) at 360 metres a.s.l on calcareous-tuffaceous soil with a northern exposure. These tuffaceous soils are characterised by a soft, friable, and porous sedimentary rock consisting of calcium carbonate and formed by evaporation, especially at the mouth of a hot spring or on a drying lake bed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matteo practices sustainable and organic viticulture, with some biodynamic practices used (not certified), including prep 500 (cow horn manure).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blend (which changes according to vintage) is 55% Verdeca &amp; 45% Minutolo (an Apulian sub-variety of Fiano). Verdeca seems to be a local variety, though it may have originated in the eastern Mediterranean. Ampelographer José Vouillamoz suggests that it is in fact the same variety as Lagorthi, a light-skinned Greek variety produced in Achaia in the north of the Peloponnese Peninsula and prized for elegant minerality and crispness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grapes are harvested manually in small crates during the early morning hours between late September and early October and then de-stemmed and vinified separately in open vats, fermenting with their own yeasts. About 20% remain in contact with their skins for a few days. Malolactic fermentation occurs naturally, whereupon ageing continues on fine lees in steel vats for a further seven months until bottling without filtration or fining and minimal added sulphites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scazzaridde has a light amber colour and sports lovely aromatics redolent of flowers, fruits and spice including chamomile, acacia, ginger, yellow apple and pear. The wine is surprisingly light on its feet with a certain savoury quality balanced by ripe citrus and a gentle lick of acidity.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>What is bang-for-buck wine?</b></h1>
<p><b>The Bang </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…happens when a wine that favourably impacts your senses. It does not have to be obvious or powerful, the proverbial 2 x4 to the cranium, but is a recognition of intrinsic quality of a wine that is good wine in itself, regardless of the price it happens to be.</span></p>
<p><b>Your Buck</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in a world in which we constantly compare one product with another, examine costs, and assess relative value-for-money. Any wine, even expensive ones, may theoretically be worth the bucks that are charged for them. For this purpose, however, I have selected wines that would normally retail at under £25 &#8211; or sell at £60 or below on any restaurant wine list with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reasonable</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> margins. Another way of looking at it, these wines that we import at a cost between €4-€6. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note the numerous causes of wine price inflation: taxes (duty, the cost of raising documents); increased transport and dried goods costs (glass in particular); spiralling rises in the cost of storage, delivery and wages. These being artisan rather than mass-produced wines with the focus on the farming and small-batch winemaking, we’ve had to work closely with our producers to ensure that we can maintain competitive selling prices without compromising quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criteria for inclusion in the list below is that the wines must be from organically farmed vineyards, fermented with their own yeasts and contain no additives other than a small/proportionate amount of sulphites. This is the minimum requirement and many of the wines below are also farmed according to biodynamic and regenerative principle and several contain no added sulphites.</span></p>

<p><b>2023 Bergerac Rouge La Vigne d’Albert, Albert de Conti</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This rustic red is a homage to Albert, the grandfather of the de Conti family, who used to enjoy a glass (a bottle) of a similar field blend when he sat down for dinner. The grapes come from the same Périgord (Mérille), Abouriou, Merlot, Cabernets (Franc and Sauvignon), Côt et Fer, simply vinified without filtration or added sulphites. A good punch of plummy fruit.</span></p>
<p><b>2022 Cahors Juvéniles, Château du Cèdre</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of the cuvée “Juvéniles” refers to both the younger generation taking over at Château du Cedre as well as the youthful style of the wine which undergoes a short gentle maceration. Lovely expressive Malbec: expressing bright red fruits aromas with a soft, supple texture. Whilst smooth and fruity, its bright acidity keeps the red plum, wild raspberry, and cherry flavours vibrant and lifted. A touch of spice and herbs (pepper and fennel) completes the picture. A wine that is best drunk fresh &#8211; or lightly chilled.</span></p>
<p><b>2021 Classique Rouge, Domaine Plaisance Penavayre, Fronton</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early 2000s, this certified organic domaine refocused on gentle growing techniques. The recipe is simple: “work the vines as closely to the terroir as possible, without fertilisers or weedkillers, favouring natural products, and harvest very ripe, healthy, grapes – all meticulously sorted.” The Classique is 60 % Négrette, 20 % Syrah, 5 % Cabernet Franc, 5 % Cabernet Sauvignon and 10 % Gamay. An aromatic wine with a superb balance of intense fruit flavours, liquorice and spicy notes and beautiful acidity.</span></p>
<p><b>2024 Lo P’tit Fantet Hippolyte Rouge, Pierre Bories</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Corbières</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classic Languedocian amalgam of Carignan, Syrah and Grenache made from organically-farmed vines and without filtering, fining or addition of sulphites. Notes of thyme, rosemary and black cherry with a hint of woody spice on the nose while the palate shows plenty of black fruits, with medium acidity, balanced tannins and a touch of minerality. The finish is smooth and lingering.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Meteore-Faugeres-Leonides.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11496" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Meteore-Faugeres-Leonides.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="741" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Meteore-Faugeres-Leonides.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Meteore-Faugeres-Leonides-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Meteore-Faugeres-Leonides-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2021 Faugères Rouge Les Léonides, Domaine du Météore</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The domaine is named after a big meteor that struck the hillside and formed a large crater. The vines have their feet in schistous soils that date from a very early geological period (the Viséen) which occurred between 345 &#8211; 326 million years ago. These schists are blue and blonde in colour. Schistous soils force the vine roots to dive deep downwards, which results in low yields. The wines result in good minerality, and reflect the perfumes of the typical Southern garrigue, a stunning landscape that provides perfect growing conditions for wild thyme, wild fennel and the fragrant local southern French rock flower called Cistus. A blend of Syrah, Grenache &amp; Cinsault. A beautiful ruby hue matched by the brightness of blackcurrant, thyme flower and a hint of balsamic. Fresh and silky in the mouth, you’ll find all the fruitiness and balance here that you’d expect of its Faugères terroir.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Navarre-St-Chinian-La-Laouzil-2022.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11497" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Navarre-St-Chinian-La-Laouzil-2022.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="729" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Navarre-St-Chinian-La-Laouzil-2022.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Navarre-St-Chinian-La-Laouzil-2022-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Navarre-St-Chinian-La-Laouzil-2022-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2022 Saint-Chinian Le Laouzil, Thierry Navarre, Languedoc</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A blend of Carignan, Cinsault, Grenache and Syrah from beautiful chemical-free vineyards in the village of Roquebrun, made in a semi-carbonic way (mix of destemmed and whole bunch grapes). It&#8217;s a wine with aromas of garrigue, ripe red fruits with hints of spices. The palate is elegant and crisp with red fruit flavours, smoky and spicy notes and soft and silky tannins. Power and elegance in equal measure.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 Côtes-du-Rhône “Bout d’Zan”, Thibon Family, Mas de Libian</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This lovely red Rhône from the Thibon family combines Grenache (mainly) and Syrah to great effect. notes of kirsch, currant jam and cranberry. A touch of sweet spice brought by the Syrah completes the superb nose. On the palate, it is very supple with recurrent flavours of red cherry and currants and more than a twist of liquorice.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thomas-Jullien-Ventoux-Rouge-Sur-Le-Fil.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11498" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thomas-Jullien-Ventoux-Rouge-Sur-Le-Fil.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="707" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thomas-Jullien-Ventoux-Rouge-Sur-Le-Fil.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thomas-Jullien-Ventoux-Rouge-Sur-Le-Fil-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thomas-Jullien-Ventoux-Rouge-Sur-Le-Fil-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2023 Ventoux Sur Le Fil, Thomas Jullien, Les Vins de Thomas</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfumed delicious red from Grenache with a little Syrah. Organic farming, gentle partly carbonic winemaking with nothing added. Wild strawberry and blueberry aromas follow through to the palate with a hint of garrigue with a long and expressive finish.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 Enlèvement Rouge, Nicolas Réau, Anjou</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fun Cabernet Franc from the Anjou region with just enough structure to be a gastronomic wine too. Aromas of flowers and small red berries. The palate is juicy and light and packed with summer fruit flavours.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 L’Hurluberlu, Sébastien David, St-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sebastien David also works in line with biodynamically precepts (and is certified by Demeter) and makes zero sulphite wines. This exuberant Cabernet Franc is fantastic value. Fermented in concrete tank and matured in Italian amphora, it is ruby red in colour with aromas of fresh red fruits, currants and vegetal notes. The palate has a light tannic structure which gives way to supple, juicy and fresh flavours. An explosion in a glass.</span></p>
<p><b>2018 Bourgueil Les Galichets, Domaine de la Chevalerie</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firmer, more sculpted style of Cabernet Franc from the historic Caslot family domaine. The nose displays aromas of raspberry and redcurrant, with notes of freshly dyed leather and pencil shavings. The palate is full of fresh, juicy red fruit flavours with a sweet and sour black cherry quality and a chocolatey, savoury richness – pronounced, but elegant tannins are married to refreshing acidity.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Le-Benjamin-Bordeaux-Rouge-2021.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11499" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Le-Benjamin-Bordeaux-Rouge-2021.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="724" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Le-Benjamin-Bordeaux-Rouge-2021.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Le-Benjamin-Bordeaux-Rouge-2021-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Le-Benjamin-Bordeaux-Rouge-2021-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2021 VdF Le Benjamin, Bordeaux Rouge</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organically-farmed Merlot with a soupcon of Petit Verdot from declassified organic vineyards in and around Lalande-de-Pomerol. Dark colour with garnet tones, the nose is fruity with black cherry and blackcurrant. Harmonious and supple with rounded tannins. Petit Verdot brings peppery and smoked flavours that complement the fruit. </span></p>
<p><b>2022 VdF Hégoa Rouge, Domaine Les 4 Vents, Bordeaux</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the wines of this young estate in Puisseguin-Saint-Emilion are named after a wind &#8211; Hégoa is a fresh wind from the Basque Country. Aged in sandstone amphora for six months and made as naturally as possible with only a tiny quantity of sulphur at bottling. Merlot dominates the inviting nose with aromas of its red black fruits and suggestions of plum cake. The palate is ample with aromas of small red fruits accompanied by a nice tension. </span></p>
<p><b>2024 Raisins Gaulois, Camille &amp; Matthieu Lapierre, Beaujolais</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grapes from relatively young vines from Lapierre family’s Morgon estate are vinified gently to expressly bring out their latent fruitiness. Ruby in colour and packed with dried cranberry and red currant fruit, this is a lovely, refreshing grapey Gamay with lively acidity. Like putting a bunch of just harvested red grapes in your mouth.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 Garnacha Gre2, Bodega A Pie de Terra, Gredos</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the granitic soils of Gredos, dry-farmed bush vines giving just 1.5 kg per vine yield excellent quality grapes that are fermented naturally and given a lengthy maceration in a variety of vessels. Impressive mountain Garnacha, not too hefty, with fine-grained tannins.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 El Pinto Tinto, Hacienda La Parrilla, Andalucía</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native Tintilla de Rota joined with Petit Verdot hailing from organic vineyards near Cadi, to produce a more full-bodied style of red with notes of kirsch and herbs. Well-made and unusual wine.</span></p>

<p><b>2023 Montsant Vi del Mas, Celler Comunica</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grown on a mix of limestone clay and granitic sand in the heart of the Montsant DO, this expressive little Mediterranean number features a blend of three Garnachas (Tinta, Peluda and Grey) with stiffening Syrah for. On the one hand, lovely freshness of red fruits, on the other, almost salty minerality.</span></p>

<p><b>2024 Vera Vides, Magna Vides, Ribera del Duero</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The baby wine from a project in Ribera del Duero wherein Andrea Sanz and Pablo Arranz are engaged with bringing old vineyards back to pulsing life. This unexpected bonny red wine is 75% Tempranillo with the remaining 25% comprising Albillo Mayor, Garnacha and Bobal, resulting in a highly drinkable style majoring on red fruits on the palate seasoned with lovely lick of spice.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 Guimaro Tinto Joven, Ribeira Sacra</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adegas Guimaro’s vineyards are situated on vertiginous terraces (the farming here is known as “heroic viticulture” cut into steep banks overlooking the River Sil. This is a youthful (joven) style of red including all the red varieties from the estate. 85% Mencía, and 15% Galician indigenous varieties – Caiño, Merenzao, Sousón, Mouraton, Garnacha Tintorera, Brancellao and Negralada. Fermented in stainless tanks, this baby Tinto is very juicy and designed to be drunk chilled.</span></p>

<p><b>2023 AT VN MN Tinto, Dominio del Urogallo, Tierra de Cangas</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From organic and biodynamically-farmed vineyards in the Narcea in southern Asturias, a smooth and characterful red from a blend of local Albarin Tinto, Verdejo Negra and Mencia &#8211; all grown organically on steep slatey slopes. Bright, juicy red and black fruits emerge, then the tannins introduce themselves subtly. The balance of fruit and tension is quite lovely and will keep you coming back for more.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 Alessandrino Rosso, Valli Unite, Piemonte</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really rustic red from a co-op dedicated to using organic and biodynamic farming methods in the vineyards with a low-intervention approach in the winery. Alessandrino is a cute blend of Dolcetto, Barbera, Croatina and Cortese. Fragrances of smoke and stone with a hint of ripe cherries. Great concentration of juicy fruit on the palate finishing dry with nice tannins and lovely digestible sourness.</span></p>
<p><b>2022 Girotondo Rosso, I Forestieri, Alta Maremma, Toscana</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the wild landscapes of Alta Maremma, two friends farm various small parcels of vines and make natural wines from them. Girotondo is Sangiovese with a little bit of Malvasia for aroma and to soften the tannins. Extraction is gentle (everything is done in cement) with a mix of whole and destemmed berries. Red fruits, cherry and undergrowth notes dominate the nose, in the mouth fresh red fruits are balanced by stemmy tannins.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 IGT Rosso Toscana, La Palazzetta, Toscana</b> <b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luca and Tea work the vineyards of La Palazzetta, on the south eastern side of Montalcino, organically. The grapes are hand-harvested and sorted. This mini-Brunello style Sangiovese is fermented in tank with its own yeasts. Intense and powerful, rich in aromas, blackberry and blueberry jam flavours combined with hints of chocolate, tobacco and balsam. </span></p>

<p><b>2021 Sassolini Rosso, Podere Sassi, Lazio</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The farm Podere Sassi lies in a beautiful location overlooking the surrounding valleys of southern Sabina. It’s a small biologic agricultural holding that is characterised by a pure, strong and unyielding approach, one devoted to a zero intervention policy that faithfully preserves Nature’s work. The colour of the Sassolini (100% Ciliegiolo) is striking, somewhere on the cusp of dark blue and purple. The nose is brimming with… yes, dark cherries – but also twists of liquorice and garrigue herbs. The natural acidity drives the wine, but the fruit, tannins and spices all harmonise to produce a stunning (and stunning value) glass of wine.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 Cancelli Rosso, Iole Rabasco, Abruzzo</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iole Rabasco inherited her family’s small vineyard and olive grove, neither of which have ever been treated with chemicals, and she’s taken that blessing and run with it. Her property is nestled in north-central Abruzzo, a region of unique meso-and micro-climates. Iole’s vines are trained high in traditional tendone style pergolas, and all vineyard work is undertaken by hand. This is Montepulciano par excellence with wonderful natural freshness tempering that classically inky-dark fruit.</span></p>

<p><b>2022 Sfuso Rosso di Anna, Etna</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">85% old bush vine Nerello Mascalese mingling with Nerello Cappuccio, Grenache and indigenous whites from various Etnean vineyards, fermented in Vino di Anna’s ancient Etna palmento as well as Georgian qvevri and finally aged in a mix of chestnut and oak casks. This is disarmingly easy to drink. Cherries, plums, spice; a juicy, flavoursome palate with fine, savoury tannins and Etna’s distinct mineral undertones.</span></p>
<p><b>2022 Pergola Criollas Tintas, Cara Sur, Calingasta, Argentina </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, which one’s pink? This almost is. The grapes used in this wine come from the ancient pergolas, typically found in the houses in this locale. It’s a special spot in every garden where families gather under its shade to socialise. Every vintage time, families in their village bring the grapes from their houses and they use them as part of this label. Cereza, Canela, Moscatel Tinto and Criolla Chica combine in this pale cherrystone fruit number that is fermented in concrete vats and old barrels. Naturally-made, just a little sulphite at bottling.</span></p>

<p><b>2021 Granitico Cinsault, A Los Vinateros Bravos, Itata, Chile</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re in Guarilihue in Chile’s Itata region. This is Leo Erazo’s “granite project” wherein he maps the soils and subsoils in meticulous detail and makes wines according to their composition. Organic farming using traditional methods, allied to the unique terroir of steep hills, granitic rock, and cool climate contribute to the elegant complexity of this wine. A Cinsault characterised by aromas of dried red fruit, liquorice and spices with a mineral finish that lingers. An eloquent translation of its granitic terroir. </span></p>

<p><b>2023 The Pink Moustache, Intellego Wines, Swartland</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delicious blend of Syrah and Cinsault from two adjacent vineyards in the Swartland. A very short maceration followed by fermentation with native yeasts in barrels and a further period in tank before bottling. Between pink and light ruby red with aromas of red berries, flowers, herbs and pepper. The palate is light, fresh and fruity with fine acidity and a juicy long aftertaste.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>What is bang-for-buck wine?</b></h1>
<p><b>The Bang </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…happens when a wine that favourably impacts your senses. It does not have to be obvious or powerful, the proverbial 2 x4 to the cranium, but is a recognition of intrinsic quality of a wine that is good wine in itself, regardless of the price it happens to be.</span></p>
<p><b>Your Buck</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in a world in which we constantly compare one product with another, examine costs, and assess relative value-for-money. Any wine, even expensive ones, may theoretically be worth the bucks that are charged for them. For this purpose, however, I have selected wines that would normally retail at under £25 &#8211; or sell at £60 or below on any restaurant wine list with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reasonable</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> margins. Another way of looking at it, these wines that we import at a cost between €4-€6. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note the numerous causes of wine price inflation: taxes (duty, the cost of raising documents); increased transport and dried goods costs (glass in particular); spiralling rises in the cost of storage, delivery and wages. These being artisan rather than mass-produced wines with the focus on the farming and small-batch winemaking, we’ve had to work closely with our producers to ensure that we can maintain competitive selling prices without compromising quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criteria for inclusion in the list below is that the wines must be from organically farmed vineyards, fermented with their own yeasts and contain no additives other than a small/proportionate amount of sulphites. This is the minimum requirement and many of the wines below are also farmed according to biodynamic and regenerative principle and several contain no added sulphites.</span></p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Our bang for buck recommendations: whites</b></h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Testalonga-Mielie-Green-Chenin.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11484" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Testalonga-Mielie-Green-Chenin.jpg" alt="" width="242" height="604" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Testalonga-Mielie-Green-Chenin.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Testalonga-Mielie-Green-Chenin-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Testalonga-Mielie-Green-Chenin-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2024 Mielie Green Chenin, Testalonga, Swartland</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enjoy aromas and flavours of dry honey and cinnamon in your Chenin then Mielie Green is for you. Dry-farmed vines from two vineyards (one 50+ years-old) with grapes whole bunch pressed into tank and barrel. A more relaxed, even mellow, style of wine from Craig, less on the nervous tension and more on the warmth.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cara-Sur-Pergolas-Criollas-Blancas-2022.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11485" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cara-Sur-Pergolas-Criollas-Blancas-2022.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="644" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cara-Sur-Pergolas-Criollas-Blancas-2022.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cara-Sur-Pergolas-Criollas-Blancas-2022-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cara-Sur-Pergolas-Criollas-Blancas-2022-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2022 Cara Sur Pergolas Criollas Blancas, Calingasta, Argentina</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This white is produced from a blend including Torrontés Sanjuanino and Mendocino as well as other Criolla varieties from old pergola vines (planted between 1920 – 1970) from multiple tiny family vineyards in Barreal and Hilario on alluvial soils. The highest vineyards are some 1,600 metres above sea level. The juice is fermented with some skins for 21 days or so, and matured in concrete, wherein the wine develops a flor (a film or veil of yeast). The resultant wine is tasty, stony and mineral, with the extra complexity in the mouth care of the flor.</span></p>

<p><b>2024 Lo P’tit Fantet d’Hippolyte, Pierre Bories, Corbières</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This delicious blend of four Mediterranean grape varieties (Roussanne, ca Marsanne, Grenache Blanc &amp; Gris) ticks boxes on terroir flavours (rocks and herbs), texture and freshness too. A firm favourite with our customers.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 Selection Massale Pinot Gris, Marlborough, New Zealand</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Selection Massale project from Dan Gillett showcases varietal wines made with minimal intervention in New Zealand. There is more than a nod to Alsace in this version of Pinot Gris which is light gold in colour, and  brimming with citrus, stonefruit and just a hint of toasted almond. The palate is light, dry and refreshing but the flavours are concentrated, and the finish saline and persistent.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Luneau-PMM-Folle-Blanche-2023.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11486" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Luneau-PMM-Folle-Blanche-2023.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="644" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Luneau-PMM-Folle-Blanche-2023.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Luneau-PMM-Folle-Blanche-2023-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Luneau-PMM-Folle-Blanche-2023-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2024 Folle Blanche, PM &amp; Marie Luneau, Pays Nantais</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One for lovers (as we are) of the underdog/ugly duckling varieties. This is Gros Plant by another name, the product of biodynamic farming methods and strict yields. No acid freakery here however! Delicate nose of citrus and white flowers greets you, then a freshness on the palate and a salty, iodine tinged character. A touch of prickliness from the lees and a crisp lemony finish completes the ensemble. If you can’t afford Muscadet…</span></p>

<p><b>2023 Ottavio Rube Bianco, Valli Unite, Piemonte</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cortese (with a snippet of Timorasso in this case) if it is not called Gavi di Gavi, and if handled in the right way, can make banging affordable wines. The Valli Unite co-op work their vineyards according to biodynamic precepts and respecting traditional farming practices. This little white conveys a mix of summer flowers, yellow plums and wild herbs held together by racy minerals. Drink whilst listening to Marillion’s The Man from Planet Marzipan.</span></p>

<p><b>2024 Vino Blanco Finca Casa Balaguer, Andres Carull, Alicante</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">30% Merseguera, 30% Malvasía, 20% Moscatel de Alejandría, 10% Tortosí &amp; 10% Verdil. indigenous varieties hailing from the mountain vineyards of Alicante. Once harvested, each variety is fermented separately in small batch concrete tanks before assembling. Deep gold (care of the portions of skin contact), displaying stone fruit and citrus on the nose with hints of white jasmine. The palate is fresh and light, developing a Mediterranean characteristic of fennel and eucalyptus. Medium bodied with a long finish the wine expresses a truly authentic Mediterranean personality.</span></p>
<p><b>2024 El Pinto Palomino, Hacienda La Parilla, Tierra de la Cadiz</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wine is 100% Palomino-by-the-sea. Organically farmed grapes are fermented spontaneously and bottled without filtration or fining. Bright golden yellow, aromatically suggestive of dried apples and yellow cherries, El Pinto has bonny acidity, chalky minerality and the requisite saline lick on the finish. An appealing intro to this variety.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 TWR Sauvignon, Marlborough, New Zealand</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna and Jason Flowerday’s much lauded (and awarded) winery in Renwick, Marlborough. Marlborough Savvy, as they call it New Zealand, has become a restaurant-list cliché that it is easy to forget that some producers work diligently to create versions which are much more than identikit mass-produced yeasted varietals. 100% Sauvignon Blanc (67% Awatere Valley, 33% Wairau Valley – Flowerday family &amp; Te Whare Ra vineyard). Renowned for their Rieslings and other aromatic varieties (from some of the oldest vineyards in the Wairau), Anna and Jason also make an exemplary Sauvignon. Light straw colour and a very appealing, fragrant bouquet of gooseberry, fresh herbs and passionfruit – a Marlborough style nose, with distinctive Awatere characters of guava, white currant and elderflower. These follow through to the palate – which is fine and soft with lots of fleshy fruit balanced by a ripe, juicy acidity.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/La-Biancara-Masieri-Bianco.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11490" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/La-Biancara-Masieri-Bianco.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="648" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/La-Biancara-Masieri-Bianco.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/La-Biancara-Masieri-Bianco-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/La-Biancara-Masieri-Bianco-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2023 Masieri Bianco, La Biancara, Veneto</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masieri Bianco is the baby Garganega from the Maule stable. This is modern natural winemaking, if you will. Attentive farming and precise winemaking, intervening only as necessary. Fresh and direct nose. Green apple, hay &amp; ripe grapes dominant. The mouth focuses on its acidity that supports the fruit and gives a slight freshness. A pleasingly simple wine that’s lively and mineral and very satisfying. A great alternative to Soave Classico.</span></p>
<p><b>2022 Miranius, Celler Credo, Penedès</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miranius is the name of the clever fox who ventures into the vineyard and is delighted by the sweet aromas of the grapes therein. It is also the name of an excellent 100% Xarel.lo made by the team at Celler Credo in the eastern Penedes, whose credo (pun intended) is that by observation and sensitive farming (biodynamics) they will rediscover the flavours of the  wines of their ancestors. This Xarel.lo speaks so clearly of vines with their feet in limestone soils. It’s fresh and apple-skins-y with a hint of gunflint reduction.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 Muscadet sur lie, Domaine de la Pepière</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great farming maketh the wine. The team at Domaine de la Pepière harvest nettles, comfrey and horsetail along the Maine River and use these plants by steeping them, fermenting them, or in the form of decoctions. Biodynamic preparations are used to reinforce the vines against disease and help the micro-biological life of the soils. The whole estate is certified in organic viticulture and is in transition to a biodynamic certification. Here we have a  great little Muscadet &#8211; lemony, stony and bracing on the palate with crunchy apple fruit, shell notes and excellent minerality.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 Alexanderhof Riesling, Bianka &amp; Daniel Schmitt, Rheinhessen</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grapes for the Riesling Alexanderhof grow in 3 different villages around the winery (Flörsheim-Dalsheim, Monsheim, Kriegsheim). The vineyard work is carried out manually and according to Demeter practices. Grapes are destemmed and pressed into stainless steel and bottled with a touch of sulphites. Peach and pear aroma with citrus finish. Malolactic fermentation gives a harmonious acidity. </span></p>
<p><b>2023 Nord-Sud Blanc, Adelaide Hills, S Australia</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nord-Sud is an Australian wine project from Anna Martens and Eric Narioo &#8211; they of Vino di Anna fame on Etna. Blanc itself is a blend of Chenin Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Fiano &amp; Riesling, vinified separately, all varieties whole-bunch pressed into a mix of stainless tanks and used puncheons, before ageing on the lees, blending and finally bottling without filtration or fining. More than the sum of its various parts, this highly potable white shows plenty of citrus and floral notes on both the nose and palate, has a fresh, lively acidity balanced by a flavoursome palate, with subtle mineral undertones. Close your eyes and you could be in Muscadet/Verdicchio/Vermentino country (delete as appropriate).</span></p>
<p><b>2024 Grüner Veltliner Handcrafted, MA Arndorfer, Kamptal</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Grüner has become deservedly popular and somewhat of a reference for overdelivering quality and interest at a pocket-friendly price. And it is a bona fide natural wine too. Made from organically-farmed Grüner grapes grown on the loess slopes of Kamptal. Harvested by hand, the majority of the grapes are pressed directly without any maceration (but 6% of the final blend is fermented on the skins for 30 days). Vinification takes place in a mix of large Austrian oval barrels and stainless steel. Golden yellow in colour, the nose is open and suggestive of ripeness with golden apple and pear William aromas. The palate is rich with fleshy fruit and good acidity, sprinkled with fresh herbs, flowers and light pepper tones.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dupraz-En-Route-Pour-lApero.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11492" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dupraz-En-Route-Pour-lApero.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="642" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dupraz-En-Route-Pour-lApero.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dupraz-En-Route-Pour-lApero-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dupraz-En-Route-Pour-lApero-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2024 En Route pour L’Apero, Domaine Dupraz, Apremont, Savoie</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re in the lieu-dit of Le Reposoir in Apremont on east-facing slopes and clay soils. The variety that thrives here is the local Jacquère. Viticulture is organic with all the work carried out by hand. Winemaking is natural with native yeasts in a mix of cement tanks and eggs and demi-muids and futs. Clean with an alpine acidity, notes of juicy pears, green apple. Almost ethereal.</span></p>
<p><b>2022 Vino de Pueblo Tres Miradas, Alvear, Montilla</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in greater Andalucia, this time at altitude on the albariza soils of the Sierra de Montilla. The Tres Miradas project is dedicated to finding the best expression of Pedro Ximenez grapes on the different terroirs in this sub-region. Fermentation of grapes takes place separately for each parcel, in concrete vats, whereupon the wine rests in the same vat on its lees for about eight months until the end of the following spring, under a layer of flor yeast. Golden wine redolent of apples, nuts and dried ginger with a good lick of acidity.</span></p>
<p><b>2023 Bourgogne-Aligoté, Domaine Goisot, Auxerre</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A beautiful Aligoté from old vines on different calcareous clay parcels farmed biodynamically. The fermentation (with native yeasts) is long and slow to preserve the voice of the terroir. A light golden colour, with brilliant green highlights. On the nose it reveals fine notes of hawthorn, green and yellow pear and hazelnut. The palate has aromas of small white flowers and spices. A brilliant Chablis alternative.</span></p>
<p><b>2024 Attention Cabernet Franc, Nicolas Reau, Anjou, Loire</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have ever woken up in the middle of night wondering what Cabernet Franc would taste like if straight-pressed, then wonder no longer. This playful Blanc de Noir is fermented in barrel and aged in tank. It is bright and crunchy and tastes straightly like still champagne (in a good sense!)</span></p>
<p><b>2023 Le Oche Bianco, Fattoria San Lorenzo, Marche</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Marche region produces outstanding value wine, and I could have included the incisive Verdicchio di Matelica from Colle Stefano or any of the whites from Ciu Ciu, not to mention the baby brother Di Gino Marche Bianco from Fattoria San Lorenzo. Le Oche is from a biodynamically-farmed single vineyard (called “Vigna delle Oche”), composed of mineral-rich chalk and clay soils. The site sits at 380m asl and faces south-west. What gives this wine its gorgeous texture is a very long ambient ferment in cement, followed by a further 12 months on the lees and another period in bottle.  Brilliant straw yellow, Le Oche has a floral and cooking spice aromas with notes of acacia, pear, almonds, elderflower and lime and a long finish with flavours of dry honey.</span></p>

<p><b>2024 Vin Blanc Clos du Tue-Boeuf, Touraine, Loire</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Puzelat family came out of the Touraine appellation in 2020 and began focusing their attention on making negoce wines from grapes grown organically (although not necessarily certified) in the region. The Vin Blanc is one such example from young Sauvignon Blanc vines, the juice naturally fermented in stainless and fibreglass vats, and aged for six months on the lees. Exhilarating wine.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Judith-Beck-Weissburgunder-2017.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-6875" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Judith-Beck-Weissburgunder-2017.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="644" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Judith-Beck-Weissburgunder-2017.jpg 1396w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Judith-Beck-Weissburgunder-2017-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Judith-Beck-Weissburgunder-2017-768x1916.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Judith-Beck-Weissburgunder-2017-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2023 Judith Beck Weissburgunder, Burgenland, Austria</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weissburgunder thrives in various parts of Austria, where it makes wines that are substantial and excellent alternatives to Chardonnay. Judith adheres to biodynamic principles in the vineyards which are warmed by the Pannonian air off central Europe. Grapes are whole bunch pressed and fermentation and ageing is in old acacia barrels which seem to lend some waxiness richness to the final wine. Refreshing aromas of citrus, pears and white peaches. The palate is full-bodied and well-structured with balanced fruit and acidity, the finish long and the ageing potential good.</span></p>
<p><b>2024 Roussette de Savoie, Domaine Bruno Lupin, Savoie</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno Lupin has become very much associated with Roussette de Savoie (as it is called locally, otherwise known as Altesse) which he farms and makes in the small commune of Frangy in Savoie. He makes several iterations of this grape, but this is fermented and aged simply in tank, and is oh-so-pure and direct, that mouthful of glacial freshness that you are secretly yearning for.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re getting used to wines being other than what they should be. Cue a woad-spattered Mel Gibson screaming “freedom!” at the top of his lungs. Vin de France has become a badge of honour for a host of growers who were happy to secede from appellations that refused to acknowledge their originality, ornery genius, and even their downright upholding of farming and winemaking practices that did not conform to the modern common denominator. Growers who refuse to compromise their principles either remove themselves or are removed from appellation. These are stories that date back to the time that the first bureaucrats crawled out of the primordial soup and began to bully the microbes. Perhaps the grower in question seeks to work with certain unrecognised varieties (including ancient ones indigenous to the region) or plant vineyards that fall outside the delimited area. Still others might be making wines that are considered atypical by tasting panels – even if the wines themselves might ironically be the most authentic representations of the traditional wine culture.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-10.06.21-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11478" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-10.06.21-AM.png" alt="" width="362" height="332" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-10.06.21-AM.png 516w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-10.06.21-AM-300x276.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all appellations work in the same pettifogging way. Some will recognise that there is no single wine type that covers all and will allow oddity and genius to express itself. Others will create a strict template for a signature style that can be recognised year after year.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vin de France has become a badge of honour for a host of growers who were happy to secede from appellations that refused to acknowledge their originality, ornery genius, and even their downright upholding of farming and winemaking practices that did not conform to the modern common denominator.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way growers react to being boxed in may be very different. Some will acknowledge that a particular wine does not conform to the requisites of appellation and will skirt delicately around the subject. On the one side, Arianna Occhipinti makes a <em>SP 68</em> Rosso (named after a road that runs alongside the side of the vineyards) that is effectively a Cerasuolo blend but does not undergo sufficient ageing to quality. Secondly, her single <em>Contrada</em> wines: <em>Bombolieri; Pettineo</em> and <em>Fossa di Lupo</em> cannot be called by their names, so they are reduced to initials, which in turn are crossed out acknowledging the appellation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there is the Vinarchiste approach of Fabien Jouves. <em>You Fuck My Wine</em> is a famous example of two fingers to the appellation, being mainly from the unloved (by appellation) Jurançon Noir grape. Of course, wine labels provide an outlet for creative dissent and there are plenty that pun on an appellation that they are not allowed to mention. We had a wine called <em>Les Mal-Aimés</em> on our list for a period, a roll call of badly-treated grapes. Nowadays, we are less impressed about what a critic believes is a noble grape variety. When one tastes the <em>Cepages Oubliés</em> wines from Thierry Navarre (Oeillades; Terret Bourret; Ribeyrenc Blanc &amp; Noir) we are not trying inferior wines, rather ones with a unique viticultural heritage that have equally unique flavours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned, there is no guarantee that using ancient local grape varieties allows one to be in the appellation. Although most of the wines made by the Plageoles family are, in fact, AOP Gaillac, they also have a wine called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terroirists</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with an agitprop style of label, being a fascinating archive of local (mostly unheard of) grapes. Meanwhile in Bergerac, another Vin de France is made in homage to de Conti’s grandfather, Albert, called (appropriately) <em>La Vigne d’Albert</em>. It is homage to the wine that Albert would drink (from his own vineyard) at the dinner table. Again a broad mix of grape varieties, some off the radar. This idea of the harvest drink and the table wine is returning, a drink often light in colour, simple and rustic, sans elevage. For so long we have been taught to admire wine unduly. Now we can engage with it! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classic certainties are being broken down and abandoned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more wines than ever that fall between various stools. Where, for example, does dark rosé end and light red begin. Some reds perhaps should be described as rosé, because the colour is so light. But isn’t this simply linguistic convenience? How can typicity apply to a whole shade of wine?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can’t. Classifications are arbitrary at best. Dividing wines into major colour categories doesn’t come closer to capturing their essence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange wines initially didn’t conform to the classic wine taste stereotypes. The colour itself was considered to be strange or wrong by many as it did not fit with their preconceptions of what wine </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look like. Even turbid wines were dismissed for their lack of typicity, as if something had gone wrong in the winemaking process. Now most of us not only accept them, we also find them interesting to describe because they prompt us to avail ourselves of terminology outside the conventional taste lexicon to find the best responses to the wines in question.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classic certainties are being broken down and abandoned</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally we have divided grape varieties into white and red, so orange wines are the ultimate swervers. Thus when Sauvignon or Chardonnay appear outside their usual “colour code”, we are puzzled at first, until we see them as orange wines rather than the varieties in question. It may be convenient to describe wine in broad brush strokes, but this ignores how different wines from the same grape, or the same region can be, due to a multitude of farming and winemaking choices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When any wine does not conform to the perceived style, then we feel we need to characterise it as being different to the mainstream examples. An oaked aged Cotat Sancerre or a wild, semi-oxidative Alexandre Bain Pouilly-Fume might be viewed as representative of unorthodox winemaking choices. In reality, they hark back to an era of different winemaking (without yeasts, temperature control, stainless tanks, filtration…) as well as articulating a different philosophical approach to farming and winemaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the natural wine world, everything is as it is. Most vignerons know that it is their name and the quality of the liquid in the bottle that sells the wine rather than the appellation on the label. And if they don’t know that the wine merchant surely does, because most people who love wine want to sell the story rather than some homogenous product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some examples. How about a red made as white: <em>Attention Cabernet Blanc</em> from Nicolas Reau in Anjou. We know that when you press grapes, no matter what colour their skin, the juice inside runs clear. Any maceration, however, will leach colour into the wine, but straight pressing and immediate removal of the skins, leads to clear wine. Now we appreciate what white Cabernet Franc tastes like (and maybe understand better what gives classic Cab Franc its recognisable aromas and flavours)!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a cheeky example of doing things the opposite way. Many wines have a pronounced red colour but their contents, so to speak, are predominantly white. Archi Guniava’s <em>Otskhanuri Sapere</em> has a lot of Tsolikouri white and a little of the inky Sapere. The result? An inky dark mostly white wine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there is the semi-reversal of that. Marto makes a wine called <em>B.A.D.</em> which is a straight-pressed Dornfelder (red grape). The wine is unexpectedly very dark indeed. Where white methods still lead to red wines.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Feints2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-4677" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Feints2.jpg" alt="" width="531" height="586" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Feints2.jpg 1536w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Feints2-272x300.jpg 272w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Feints2-768x849.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Feints2-927x1024.jpg 927w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Field blends of red and white grapes tend to work out in the wash as pink or very light red. This style of winemaking is usually the result of co-plantation and co-fermentation. Evan Lewandowski’s <em>Feints</em> is one such example, seeing Arneis (mainly) mixed with Dolcetto, Barbera and Nebbiolo. I Vigneri &amp; Vino di Anna make examples of field blends, intermixing red and white. The wines themselves may be pink and medium red in colour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wines that are juicy blends of red and white grapes are still very popular in natural wine bars where </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gluggabilité</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is deemed a desirable quality. One could say that medium/dark (but light bodied) pink wines have become the new pink wines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding white grapes to ameliorate red wines has a notable tradition. Sangiovese has been lifted with a little Trebbiano in Chianti for years, Syrah given a soupçon of Viognier in Côte-Rôtie. The wines may be less strikingly powerful, but they may become more aromatic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winemaking choices play an integral role in subverting one’s expectations of the customary style of a wine or grape variety. With its 5-day maceration, Judith Beck’s <em>Honey Bunny</em> might be termed a reverse Blaufränkisch, showing the playful side of this serious grape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of winemaking is a swerve in the sense that the vigneron has the option of setting the grape juice on whatever path they desire. Some producers love the salty umami notes that ageing under flor gives to the wine &#8211; and positively encourage it. If we don’t expect to find these aromas and flavours, until we commit to them the wine may seem too odd.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all carry cherished expectations around within us and are attached to the idea of typicity. When a wine does not fit in our preconceived notion of what it should taste like, we may deem it atypical even if it is made with the best of intentions by the vigneron. It is so much more complex than that. </span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For decades, a Chardonnay from the New World was conceived as toasty-rich, oaky, and leesy. And as a winemaker, you wouldn’t abandon your calling card and as a consumer it was comforting to know exactly what the wine would taste like. However, tastes change. Winemakers began to tire of making this style of wine and started to make something called Unwooded or Unoaked Chardonnay to warn consumers about the “different” style of Chardonnay. Fast forward a few years, and Chardonnay without oak is much more common and more in tune with what people feel like drinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The swerve lies partly in the wine and partly in the perceiver. We all carry cherished expectations around within us and are attached to the idea of typicity. When a wine does not fit in our preconceived notion of what it should taste like, we may deem it atypical even if it is made with the best of intentions by the vigneron. It is so much more complex than that. Our taste is the sum total of our influences and experiences; the wine is the sum total of the thousand decisions (say) that bring it into being and therefore has its own integrity whether we like it, or recognise it. Natural wines, for example, are regarded as delicious by those who enjoy the low-intervention style and faulty by those who don’t. It is almost as if it is less to do with the actual taste and more to do with what we feel about wine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of an amber/skin contact wine thirty years ago was almost inconceivable, and even 15 years ago would be regarded by restaurant wine buyers and their consumers as weirdly offbeat. Now a wine list without an amber wine or section devoted to them, seems deficient. Eventually, the wine swerve turns into a straight line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without growers experimenting, pushing the envelope, finding a wine style that speaks to them and the people who drink their wines, and even reviving ancient traditions of wines and winemaking, the wine world would be a more boring place. One need not live on appellations alone; pear-shaped incongruity enlivens the wine diet.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>&#8216;Tween seasons (summer &amp; autumn) bottles</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">End of summer sounds so final. Like the end of childhood. I always associate September with going back after hols like “the whining school-boy, with his satchel/And shining morning face, creeping like snail/Unwillingly to school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are really hoping for the dividend of extended summer followed by an Indian summer, basking in the still-glory days of warmth and the light, as if sequestering it to release back into one’s being during the dark winter days. Think of the extra rosé sales! Anyhoo, I wax whimsy.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am slowly moving away from clean and salty whites to ones with more texture; and from pinky and perky rosés to light-to-medium eminently-chillable reds.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wine wise, I am also trying to extend the feel of summer by drinking wines that are not heavy, although as a concession to August melting into September and spiralling further downwards into October, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am slowly moving away from clean and salty whites to ones with more texture; and from pinky and perky rosés to light-to-medium eminently-chillable reds.</span></p>
<h2><b>The whites</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bottes-Rouges-Face-B-Jura-Savagnin-NV-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11467" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bottes-Rouges-Face-B-Jura-Savagnin-NV-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="748" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bottes-Rouges-Face-B-Jura-Savagnin-NV-scaled.jpg 1026w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bottes-Rouges-Face-B-Jura-Savagnin-NV-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bottes-Rouges-Face-B-Jura-Savagnin-NV-410x1024.jpg 410w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bottes-Rouges-Face-B-Jura-Savagnin-NV-768x1916.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bottes-Rouges-Face-B-Jura-Savagnin-NV-616x1536.jpg 616w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bottes-Rouges-Face-B-Jura-Savagnin-NV-821x2048.jpg 821w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2022 Face B Savagnin, Les Bottes Rouges</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winemakers Jean-Baptiste Menigoz and Florien Kleine Snuverink are a farm vines (7 ha of them) and ferment low-intervention wines in the heart of Jura’s Arbois region. The grape palette includes Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Ploussard, Trousseau and, of course, Savagnin, all grown organically and with biodynamic treatments when needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Face B’ is whole cluster direct-pressed Savagnin that is aged for at least 18 months in old oak barrels on the fine lees before emerging as a gorgeous butterfly. Spun gold with complex aromatic notes of ginger-flecked butter, white flowers and coconut shaving with a mouth full of pear, grapefruit and an array of warmed spices from clove to cumin. This fleshy, well-toned wine tastes like very early autumn dissolved in a glass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sheer quality of the wine also made me think about how we tend to fixate on certain regional growers (call it Jurassic snobbery) and place them and their wines onto a pedestal without admitting that other under-the-radar/less-fashionable growers may be producing wines that are even more delicious and at a much more attractive price.</span><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kelley-Fox-Willamette-Chardonnay.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11468" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kelley-Fox-Willamette-Chardonnay.jpg" alt="" width="303" height="756" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kelley-Fox-Willamette-Chardonnay.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kelley-Fox-Willamette-Chardonnay-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kelley-Fox-Willamette-Chardonnay-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Kelley Fox Willamette Chardonnay, Oregon</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelley’s 2023 Chardonnay is the third iteration made from a parcel of young vines in the Freedom Hill vineyard. The 2024 will see a marked change in style, being a blend of Durant and Freedom Hill Chardonnays, with concrete amphora and Burgundian barrels creating a different flavours and textures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Situated in the foothills of the Oregon Coast range near Dallas, Freedom Hill vineyard is technically in the Mt. Pisgah-Polk County AVA, just outside the lines drawn for the Eola Hills AVA. The top producers of Oregon Pinot noir have been making wines of excellence-consistently- from Freedom Hill for decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bellpine marine sedimentary soil type, the source for this being an ancient seabed, seems to suit white grape varieties (particularly Kelley’s Pinot Blanc) and imbue the wines with their bright urgent acidity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Willamette Chardonnay is still fermented and matured in stainless steel tank in 2023, it certainly feels very different to the two previous vintages. The nose has hints of vanilla along with creamy tropical fruits, mixed citrus, and soft minerals. These delicious fruits are perfectly balanced by its fresh acidity. The mouth mirrors the nose, and the texture and finish are silky and pleasing. More Mâcon than Chablis if you like.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Judith-Beck-Furmint-Bambule-ORGANIC-2023.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11469" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Judith-Beck-Furmint-Bambule-ORGANIC-2023.jpeg" alt="" width="301" height="751" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Judith-Beck-Furmint-Bambule-ORGANIC-2023.jpeg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Judith-Beck-Furmint-Bambule-ORGANIC-2023-120x300.jpeg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Judith-Beck-Furmint-Bambule-ORGANIC-2023-410x1024.jpeg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2023 Furmint Bambule, Judith Beck</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have already decanted this wine in a recent blog post, but just to rehash the main points. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furmint, when Burgenland was still part of Hungary, was an important grape variety in the environs of Lake Neusiedl. It was used mainly for the production of sweet wines. After the collapse of the monarchy, the variety fell into oblivion. In 2017,  Judith planted a small vineyard of Furmint, which they considered a very interesting variety because of its marked acid structure. It also had a pronounced aroma and a certain “fieriness”, which is a counterpart to the acidity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grapes are hand harvested, destemmed and undergo five days of maceration in open top stainless-steel vat before ambient fermentation in old tonneaux with indigenous yeast and a further period of ageing in used barrels of 500 litres. The wine completes malolactic fermentation and is bottled without filtration, fining or added sulphites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Furmint Bambule has vibrant aromas of green apple, quince, and citrus zest, balanced by subtle floral notes and a distinct minerality, culminating in a crisp, refreshing finish that highlights its lively acidity and complexity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wine fits a late summer need for me, capturing adroitly the tension between fleshy x skin fruit, acidity and salinity.</span></p>
<h2><b>The reds</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bottes-Rouges-Ploussard-Tot-ou-Tard-2022.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11470" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bottes-Rouges-Ploussard-Tot-ou-Tard-2022.jpg" alt="" width="301" height="751" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bottes-Rouges-Ploussard-Tot-ou-Tard-2022.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bottes-Rouges-Ploussard-Tot-ou-Tard-2022-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bottes-Rouges-Ploussard-Tot-ou-Tard-2022-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2023 Les Bottes Rouges Poulsard Tôt ou Tard</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second wine from the camp of Menigoz and Snuverink and here from the much admired Poulsard variety. I am a touch ambivalent about this grape. Often masked by cold carbonic maceration techniques, it can also be a bit weedy and bitter or marked by reduction, yet, in the hands of skilled vignerons it bequeaths a haunting perfume and slivery darts of bright red fruits. In a more technical sense: yum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tôt ou Tard is 100% Poulsard, bottled in May after the vintage. After harvesting, the fruit is destemmed then macerated for three weeks and before ageing in stainless steel tanks. The nose is ripe watermelon and cherry with the merest hint of forest floor, while the palate conveys a balance of acid and fruit accentuated by bitterness and mineral notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2023 has a breezy cool-fruited character to it that is quite captivating.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Navarre-Ribeyrenc-VDF-Rouge.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11471" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Navarre-Ribeyrenc-VDF-Rouge.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="746" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Navarre-Ribeyrenc-VDF-Rouge.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Navarre-Ribeyrenc-VDF-Rouge-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Navarre-Ribeyrenc-VDF-Rouge-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2024 VdF Ribeyrenc, Thierry Navarre</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ribeyrenc, also Rybeyrenc, though grape encyclopaedias will have it under the more prosaic-sounding Aspiran noir), is a variety that was traditionally grown between Minervois and Clermont l’Hérault, but it all but died out with phylloxera and the big frost of 1956. All was not lost, however, as Thierry Navarre’s grandfather had some vines. The cultivar is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate, and intriguingly, it ripens late being picked towards the end of September, usually a recipe for high alcohol, but in this case always a light abv of around 11.5-12%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 7 ha of this now rare grape variety remain in the Languedoc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ribeyrenc Noir prefers to be grown in the hills, rather than on the plain. This version derives from vines on south-east facing slopes on slate (brown schist). Yields are a measly 17 hl/ha, farming is organic with herbal preparations. Triage is done in the vineyard and the winery. Thierry does not destem as the skin of the grapes is so thin and fragile. The grapes gently fall into the small cement vats where they ferment. Ageing in cement vats is for 6 months. No oak, naturally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wine itself is enchantingly demure. The colour is pale red, the nose has some light perfume (violets and peonies), the palate is very mellow, with some fresh cherry fruit and the merest whisper of garrigue and white pepper. It’s delicious and takes longer to pronounce than to drink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lovely red for the late summer and never to be drunk without a decent cooling down period in the fridge.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Vale-da-Capucha-Palhete.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11472" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Vale-da-Capucha-Palhete.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="754" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Vale-da-Capucha-Palhete.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Vale-da-Capucha-Palhete-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Vale-da-Capucha-Palhete-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2023 Vale da Capucha Matacaes Palhete</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither red, white nor rosé (or perhaps all of them) this Palhete is 70% Arinto (white grape) &amp; 30% Castelão (red grape), indigenous Portuguese grapes are sourced from Capucha’s coastal vineyards, benefiting from the cooling influence of the Atlantic winds. The viticulture here is characterized by minimal intervention, allowing the vines to express their natural character and the nuances of the terroir. Hand-harvesting ensures careful selection of the grapes, preserving their quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capucha employs artisanal winemaking techniques in the winery, including &#8211; in this example &#8211; co-fermentation of the red and white grapes in stainless steel tanks. This co-fermentation, a defining characteristic of Palhete, is essential for achieving the wine&#8217;s characteristic light colour and delicate flavour profile. The wine is then aged in stainless steel tanks, preserving its freshness and fruit-forward character. Minimal sulphur additions are used, reflecting a commitment to natural winemaking practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Red fruit aromas abound here such as strawberry, raspberry, and red currant, accompanied by subtle floral and herbal undertones. The co-fermentation with Arinto contributes subtle citrus and white floral notes, adding complexity to the aromatic profile. On the nose, the Palhete also offers subtle vegetal notes, underpinned by mineral and smoky nuances that reflect the limestone-rich soils. The palate is elegant, with an enveloping texture and a refreshing acidity that imparts a gastronomic quality to the wine.. This balance of fruit, minerality, and freshness makes it a versatile companion to various dishes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This style of wine is still a popular one in the region as well as being a reminder of what people used to drink over a hundred years ago. Locals preferred a wine that was very light because it was intended to be drunk to kill the thirst whilst working outside under the hot sun. Also known as “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palheto</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which is different from “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clarete</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which is made with red grapes only.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mosse-Bangarang-Rouge-2024.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11473" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mosse-Bangarang-Rouge-2024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="749" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mosse-Bangarang-Rouge-2024.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mosse-Bangarang-Rouge-2024-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mosse-Bangarang-Rouge-2024-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><b>2024 Bangarang Rouge, Famille Mosse</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jolly Bangarang is more about style than specifics. The blend of grapes from different sources changes according to the year, but the wine is consistently fun and extrovert. This year it as an assemblage of local heroes Cabernet Franc, Grolleau Noir and Pineau d’Aunis grapes that were purchased from their friends. The grapes were hand harvested from certified organic vines that are around 30 years of age from vineyards near the villages of Faye d’Anjou, Bonnezeaux and Beaulieu sur Layon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grolleau was destemmed then macerated for a week to extract some colour, whereupon the juice was transferred to tank for fermentation. The other two grape varieties were directly pressed before going into tank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final wine does what it says on the label. Exuberant strawberry and candied red cherry with a dash of Pineau d’Aunis white pepper. Glouglou and then some, but with more than enough interest to keep going until the bottle is demolished. Although for me this wine represents mid-summer frolics and the joys of al fresco dining and drinking, it is also a wine that I will return to up to the autumn equinox.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Why are you not tasting what I am tasting? (I ask silently)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are you making undue allowances for a wine that is plainly not interesting? To me!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every rhetorical observation like this has “in my opinion” appended to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more I talk about taste and my particular preferences, the more I truly believe that I am imprisoned by my very particular likes. Much as wine professionals may claim to possess objective and discriminating palates, they are still locked into a mindset of liking &#8211; or disliking &#8211; a wine. For the reasons that may have been instilled into us by wine educators, or because we have developed our personal sense of taste over the years. Or, because to our tongues, some flavours are appealing, and others are aversive. As professionals, we fondly believe that we assemble the evidence, break down the wine into its objective components and assess its quality having weighed up all the pros and cons, but in reality we make instantaneous judgements and work out why we feel the way we do about a wine afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that taste is necessarily fixed. Liking and disliking are fluid. You may dismiss a wine at first, only to discover hidden depths and consequently may row back on your initial reaction. Or you think you are going to love a wine only to find that it changes and diminishes with each sip.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt disappointed in myself rather than the wines themselves, as if I had been placed in front of an artistic masterpiece and was not able to react at all.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, one can trust one’s instinct. If the wine doesn’t feel right, then it probably isn&#8217;t right for you (at that point in time).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some wines, however, barely register on your consciousness, and you would rather not drink at all then take even a little sip. A mediocre wine is not an average wine. Barely adequate, it is extremely average, not worthy to detain our interest. The majority of wines fall into this mediocre category and will share common denominator characteristics that indicate their functional nature.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Is it just me?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are days – we all experience them – when your taste buds seem less attuned to the quality of the wines and it is difficult to manifest enthusiasm. Every wine is good enough in its own right, but you are not thirsty for them, to coin an expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one recent dinner for wine lovers from the trade, each person brought two bottles which we opened, tasted and discussed. Whilst none were mediocre, in most cases I couldn’t feel why I should like the wine. I felt disappointed in myself rather than the wines themselves, as if I had been placed in front of an artistic masterpiece and was not able to react at all. I know that my palate is configured in such a way that unwonted foreign flavours are deemed intrusive. I am worried because others are cooing over wines, and I am in the minority. I may not be enjoying the wines because there are too many and we are “gorging”. One slurp to judge and onto the next. And the next. The best tasting is at the pace that best suits you or else you scarcely taste at all. Or put another way, tasting wine involves having a relationship with the bottle, not just the snapshot of smell and flavour.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Which brings me to trade tastings</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large companies tend to hold two major events, often in swanky bunting-adorned locations, with several hundred wines on show, attended by the producers and brand ambassadors. It’s often a case of never mind the quality, feel the width. Small merchants pop up all over the place and at irregular intervals. A couple of dozen bottles popped open of the bar of a bistro here, a combined tasting with other companies of likeminded wine philosophy at some super-cool venue there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the years when it took place, <a href="https://realwinefair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Real Wine Fair</a> was our big statement tasting, but it was always to promote the greater glory of the world of natural wine and the quality and the diverse approaches of the growers who make these artisan wines. Our other events have been small and focused. We try to incorporate a theme, so that those who attend know what to expect. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.30.51-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11462" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.30.51-AM.png" alt="" width="501" height="497" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.30.51-AM.png 472w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.30.51-AM-300x297.png 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.30.51-AM-150x150.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, in conjunction with Sager &amp; Wine, we explored the wines of Georgia. Although we have held Georgian tastings before, the purpose here was to reinforce the fact that tiny Georgia is a country of several discrete regions, traditions and winemaking styles. It is a country of change too, where  natural producers look forward as well as back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, we organised a tasting at Brawn, featuring our Savoie portfolio (small but perfectly formed) followed by a celebration of the Gringet grape, where we bought, borrowed and called in samples of this wonderful unique grape. This miniature comparative tasting felt like part of history as well as being an homage to Gringet-meister, Dominique Belluard.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.33.28-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11463" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.33.28-AM.png" alt="" width="500" height="491" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.33.28-AM.png 587w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-15-at-11.33.28-AM-300x295.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We did have a more generic event in April, but it was still based on a precise premise rather than a scattergun flinging of 100+ different wines on the table. Called “More splosh for your dosh”, a title heartily disliked by my fellow Pyrensters, it concentrated on wines below £25 retail (with the vast majority of wines under £20). The words bang and buck were never far from our lips and those of customers. In these straitened times, we need natural wines at great value prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final tasting of the first half of the year was entitled “Kindred Spirits”, which brought together four of our eaux-de-vies and spirits producers (again at Brawn) to pour and talk about their products, several of which  were then used as the basis of cocktails created by Liam Davy, mixologist extraordinaire from Hawksmoor group, and also finally featured in dishes at a wine dinner cooked by Ed Wilson. It was satisfying to see this three-part event come to fruition (macerated in eaux-de-vie) as it illustrated that thinking and drinking outside the tasting box can be attractive for those who are jaded and bewildered by the sheer welter of events. Les Caves de Pyrene: never knowingly overloading you!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-09-at-10.44.23-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11458" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-09-at-10.44.23-AM.png" alt="" width="790" height="338" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-09-at-10.44.23-AM.png 729w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-09-at-10.44.23-AM-300x128.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://sclavoswines.gr/en/winery-kefalonia-wine-kefalonia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sclavos family</a> traces its roots back for centuries in Cephalonia. A branch of the family emigrated in 1700 to the Black Sea port of Odessa in modern day Ukraine. As early as 1860 records exist of Evriviadis’s great-great grandfather owning a large winery and family estate in Odessa. In 1919, following the Russian revolution, Evriviadis’ grandfather returned to the island of Cephalonia to their property of 6 hectares in the Paliki peninsula where he planted his first vines of Mavrodaphne and Vostilidi, some of which are still producing today. Two generations later the vineyards are assiduously cared for and have been cultivated biodynamically for the past twenty years. In addition to this Sclavos also sources another 4 hectares from local farmers in the Robola zone of the island and have recently planted their own vines within the area.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sclavos family traces its roots back for centuries in Cephalonia</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vineyard where the Tsaousi is grown is in Palli Monabeles, a mountainous part of the south of the island, on the slopes of Mount Ainos. It lies 250m above sea level on a type of limestone rock with marl called “Maltese slab.” The climate here is Mediterranean, with mild, rainy winters and hot, sunny summers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biodynamic methods have been employed for 20+ years, and the vineyard is accredited by the DIO organisation. Methods include the use  of biological remedies and preparations, the restoration of balance in the soils, and following lunar and cosmic influences. The vines are 70-years-old own-rooted, yielding a mere 250 kg/acre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vines grow on organically poor soils and the vineyard itself is heterogeneous incorporating forest, olive groves and other areas set aside for natural conservation, including a great diversity of rare Mediterranean plant species, orchids, and others. Due to the gentle methods applied, the soil in the vineyards &#8211; &#8211; hosts many earthworms that contribute to the health of the soil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grapes are manually harvested and destemmed before sorting. They are straight pressed and fermented with indigenous yeasts and cool temperatures in stainless-steel tanks. The wine is aged for six months on its fine lees, also in stainless tank, and is bottled without filtration or fining and only minimal sulphites at bottling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tsaousi has an intense aromatic character, with notes of yellow flowers, sea and mountain air, and chalk. The palate is bright and clear, with brilliant mouthwatering acidity sporting notes of yellow apple, chalk, crushed oyster shell, and a delicately savoury finish. Despite its reputation as a low acid whose main purpose is to blend with the local Robola, this has the thrilling personality and energy of old vines white wine from active limestone mother rock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-09-09-at-10.43.21-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11457" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-09-09-at-10.43.21-AM.png" alt="" width="244" height="609" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-09-09-at-10.43.21-AM.png 612w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-09-09-at-10.43.21-AM-120x300.png 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-09-09-at-10.43.21-AM-411x1024.png 411w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></a>2024 Tsaousi</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italy was known as Enotria Tellus, the land of vines. Metternich said that Italy was “a geographical expression.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the Alpine valleys of Valle d’Aosta to its baking southern Mediterranean coast, Italy is many countries in one with a fascinating diversity of cultures, climates and wine styles. Italian wines can match any in the world for regional heritage and expression of terroir. Our list contains many examples of relatively rare traditional local varieties as well as more classic ones. Here is a selection of the former.</span></p>
<h2><b>Cesanese</b></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ciolli good</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Damiano-Ciolli-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11450" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Damiano-Ciolli-2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Damiano-Ciolli-2.jpg 1008w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Damiano-Ciolli-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Damiano-Ciolli-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Damiano-Ciolli-2-768x1152.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damiano Ciolli cultivates the lesser-seen native Cesanese d’Affile grapes in the hills of  Olevano Romano, south east of Rome. The vineyards are on deep red soils of volcanic origin at 450 m altitude and are refreshing by a daily breeze off the Tyrrhenian Sea. Farming organically, he and his partner, focus on low yields and rigorous selection to bring out the variety’s attributes. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cesanese Selene</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a blend of four vineyard blocks) has a forward nose revealing pleasant fruity aromas of cranberries and pomegranate, dried roses and herbs. The palate is crisp and lean with notes of wild herbs and aromatic spices (think juniper), nicely balanced with good tannins that blend perfectly with a mineral hint.</span></p>
<h2><b>Aleatico</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Andrea-Occhipinti-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11451" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Andrea-Occhipinti-2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Andrea-Occhipinti-2.jpg 1176w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Andrea-Occhipinti-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Andrea-Occhipinti-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Andrea-Occhipinti-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Andrea-Occhipinti-2-1024x1536.jpg 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Occhipinti is on a mission to show that Aleatico can perform every which way. His straight-pressed Bianco version is truly an “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alter Alea</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, whilst the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alea Viva </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a more familiar dark red wine with Aleatico aromatics of cherry liqueur, wild roses and violets and red Muscat grapes. His </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcaico Rosso</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pairs Grechetto (Rosso) with Aleatico to elegant effect. This latter is another wine that is graced by terracotta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Theories abound as to the origins of Aleatico, the main being that it is related to the Muscat Blanc a Petits Grains and that it may have been brought to Italy by the ancient Greeks. During his exile on Elba, the Aleatico wines of the island supposedly became a favourite drink of Napoleon. He was reported to have said that they were his only consolation during this time.</span></p>
<h2><b>Ciliegiolo</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first documented references to Ciliegiolo are from the early 17</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century when the Florentine writer Soderini described a “Ciregiuolo dolce” with a long bunch, a somewhat large berry, and a sweet – “dolce” – and fragrant flavour. This description of the physical characteristics of the variety corresponds to present-day Ciliegiolo, as does the observation that the grape does best in notably warm climates. There exists, nonetheless, in popular and folk descriptions of Ciliegiolo, another tradition which attributes the origins of the grape to Spain and ascribes its presence in Italy to pilgrims who returned with it to Italy from the sanctuary of Saint James in Compostela. Hence the other name once widely used for the grape in Italy: “Ciliegiona rossa tonda di Spagna”, or the “red and round Ciliegiona of Spain”.  Nowadays, Ciliegiolo is cultivated almost exclusively in Umbria and Tuscany.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of the grape comes from an Italian word for cherry which Ciliegiolo wines resemble in colour and perfume. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sassolini Rosso</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hails from Tarano in Lazio on the Umbrian border. Despite the fact that the vineyard is young, the grapes produce a wine of remarkable intensity and vibrancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grape features in Andrea Occhipinti’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alkes Rosato</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where it is macerated for just a few hours and fermented naturally in tank. Vibrant fruity nose and on the palate, notes of mediterranean herbs. Refreshing rosé with good acidity, the San Ferdinando Ciliegiolo Rosso from Val di Chiana in Tuscany where the wine has aromas of sour cherries, raspberries, woody green herbs, and a hint of lavender as well as featuring heavily in Antonio Camillo’s Mediterraneo Rosso blend.</span></p>
<h2><b>Grignolino</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grignolino has been planted in Piedmont in the area between Asti and Casale, where it originated, since the eighth century. Still confined almost entirely to hillside vineyards in the provinces of Asti and Alessandria, it has only two appellations: Grignolino d’Asti and Grignolino del Monferrato Casalese. The name of the vine is likely derived from a word in local dialect, “grignòle,” which refers to the high number of seeds in the berry. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brich Grignolino </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from Agricola Gaia is light, fresh, fruity, refreshing but insubstantial (that’s the way we like it) and decidedly to be drunk soon after the vintage. It offers bright red fruit with notes of herbs and flowers, with a hint of bitterness on the finish. This would be lovely lightly chilled with the festive </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bagna cauda</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and even better consumed by the gallon with a bollito misto. There is no World Grignolino Conference – yet. Unripe Grignolino is said to be green—yolino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who enjoy your Piedmontese grapes with an extra rasp, then Freisa and Slarina are also worth investigating.</span></p>
<h2><b>Gaglioppo</b></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with so many Italian grapes, ampelographers have various theories as to the origins of Gaglioppo. One is that it is one of the many descendants of Sangiovese, another that it was brought over from Greece. Whichever is the case, it has adapted to the hot and dry climate of Calabria and can produce highly distinctive wines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past ten years Cataldo Calabretta, one of the pioneers of the noble Calabrian Gaglioppo variety, has worked according to principles of organic farming, an ethical choice. He cultivates vines on hilly land located in the heart of the DOC, uses only indigenous yeasts and doesn’t add anything to the wines other than a minimal amount of sulphites. In the cellar, they renewed an old cement cuve, which proves to be an excellent vessel for the ageing of Cirò wine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaglioppo is a very tannic and acidic variety that during the 80s and 90s was perhaps somewhat stripped of its original elements and made in the roundest and softest incarnation possible, losing the otherwise sharp and angular characteristics of the grape. Treated properly, it is a serious wine that can hold its head high against Nebbiolo, Sangiovese, and Nerello. Cataldo’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cirò Rosso Classico Superiore,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reveals a bright brick red colour (even in youth) which is the hallmark of this variety. Ethereal on the nose, the fruit is initially shy, but coaxed out of its shell, reveals a range of flavour including leather, liquorice and dried prunes. There is plenty of tannin, but its natural high acidity is an elegant Gaglioppo further enhanced by the salinity which characterises wines from the Ionian coast.</span></p>
<h2><b>Sagrantino</b></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here for the Bea</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Giampiero-Bea-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11452" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Giampiero-Bea-1.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="858" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Giampiero-Bea-1.jpg 1358w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Giampiero-Bea-1-210x300.jpg 210w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Giampiero-Bea-1-717x1024.jpg 717w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Giampiero-Bea-1-768x1097.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Giampiero-Bea-1-1076x1536.jpg 1076w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sagrantino centres on the village of Montefalco in Umbria. The first written record of it dates from the 16</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century as a communion wine, although Pliny the Elder talked about red wines from Montefalco (which may have been our grape in question). The grape was originally used to make passito-style wines until the 1970s and the vogue for powerful dry reds began to emerge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A characteristic of the variety is its intensely dark colour and thick skins and big pips, all of which contribute to it being one of the most tannic varieties in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A truly artisan producer making organic hand-crafted wines. References in the archive of Montefalco, a beautiful Umbrian hill town (aren’t they all?), document the presence of the Bea family in this region as early as 1500. This tiny estate is the classic Italian </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fattoria</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, producing wine, raising farm animals for trade and home consumption and working the land to produce olives, fruits and vegetables. Paolo Bea, the senior member of the family, is the guiding force behind the production of these intensely pure wines, assisted by his son, Giuseppe, who farms the vineyards and Giampero who looks after the vinification. No herbicides or pesticides are used at Paolo Bea. He believes that wine is an expression of nature and looks forward to the differences in each harvest. The wines are produced in the traditional way; grapes are handpicked and bottled without filtration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sagrantino is the predominant grape, covering 60% of the vineyard area. The remaining 40% is planted to Sangiovese and Montepulciano, with a small parcel planted to several white grape varieties. All grapes are harvested manually, and the reds undergo an extensive cuvaison that lasts between five to eight weeks with punch downs during fermentation. Malolactic fermentation occurs spontaneously in stainless steel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bea’s Montefalco Sagrantino </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pagliaro</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes from a hilltop parcel of south-facing vines on clay-limestone and gravel soils and feels like it is sculpted out of earth and stone. After fermentation the wine spends around 24 months in stainless tanks and a further lengthy period on the lees in Slavonian oak botti before bottling (without fining or filtration) and, if sulphur is added, it is only a small amount and before bottling. This Sagrantino is epic with its full, powerful nose of raisined berries and smoke, and a palate that unfolds an array of blackberries, currants, cinnamon and clove, one that is mouth-filling, warm and dense.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What sort of wines make me think, &#8216;yes, I am now on holiday&#8217;?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-23-at-12.20.42-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11440" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-23-at-12.20.42-PM.png" alt="" width="438" height="520" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-23-at-12.20.42-PM.png 438w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-23-at-12.20.42-PM-253x300.png 253w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am nothing if not predictable. My holidays are always spent in the same cottage in the same location. My children are unaware that other places exist. Admittedly, the island where we stay is beautiful with scenery to delight and plenty of activities to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s not to love? Other than the weather during our stay. We will take any crumb of comfort. A shaft of sun would do for starters. This year we endured a hurricane and a succession of gales to wave us off, but the important thing was “nae midges”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we arrive for our holiday, I invariably send an advance battalion of cases of liquid loveliness, a Whisky Galore of wine to retrieve at my leisure. In the event of wine drought. Far more than we could possibly wish to drink. The idea being that one’s desert island is really a fantasy island, and one’s holiday a celebration of the escape from everyday drinking.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-23-at-12.34.53-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11443" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-23-at-12.34.53-PM.png" alt="" width="517" height="452" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-23-at-12.34.53-PM.png 503w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-23-at-12.34.53-PM-300x262.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I have said in previous blogs, there is little to compare with the glorious sensation of bringing a bottle of one’s favourite wine down to where the ocean kisses the graceful curve of the sandy bay as the dipping sun sends golden rays into your eyes and turns the western skies all manner of pinks and purples. You live in the elevated beauty of the moment. Brief ecstasy ensues. This year, however, because of zero sunsets and extreme windy conditions, there were no such opportunities to experience delicious wines further amplified by Nature’s glory.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we arrive for our holiday, I invariably send an advance battalion of cases of liquid loveliness, in the event of wine drought.

</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, we can’t always dial-up-an-epiphany. The experience of wine is challenged and changed by context and mood. I notice is that my enjoyment is that much greater when I (am allowed to) bring a bottle to the restaurant as opposed to ordering off the list and paying full price. I guess this marks me out as some kind of wine brat. I am not sure whether it is the principle of not paying that appeals (surely I am not that mean), or rather that I am forced to choose the least of all evils from a list that I have no control over, a wine that I would not necessarily wish to drink on the evening in question. When that wine happens to be not “just so”, you are disappointed having to pay for what you never really wanted to drink in the first place. It is a small regret that life’s too short for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What sort of wines make me think, &#8216;yes, I am now on holiday&#8217;? Fizz, for sure. The carefree snap, crackle and pop of beaded bubbles. For me, the ancestral method sparklers of Camillo Donati hit the mark and are the bookends to our vacation with that first gulp of Trebbiano Frizzante akin to the sensation of setting foot on one’ favourite sandy beach after a long absence. Anything from Marie-Courtin is my go-to lavish meditation champagne, and this year I also brought a bottle of Louis Roederer Brut Nature Blanc (Philippe Stark label), a wine I have never tried before, emblematic of the fact that holidays are for treating oneself and one’s loved ones.</span></p>

You live in the elevated beauty of the moment. Brief ecstasy ensues.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rosé wine is consumed more often than not. The colour alone breathes heat and liquid sunshine and the temporary abrogation of responsibility. Binner Si Rose (technically not a rosé rather a solera amalgam of skin-contact Gewurz and Pinot Gris) and Vino di Anna Jeudi 15 Rosato were two highlights, and despite the fact that they were consumed against doomy skies, they brought their interior sunshine to the party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being beside the seaside, beside the sea, my palate invariably craves corresponding salinity in the wines. In this regard, a Folle Blanche (vieilles vignes) from Marc Pesnot, a wine akin to liquidised oyster shell, hit the spot perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sombre skies normally produce a yearning for red wines. This year, bar one spanking bottle of Thierry Germain Saumur-Champigny, I was red-averse, preferring to go orange instead for my shivers of gently abrasive tannin. And what a wine we drank! Pequeñita Rioja Reserva Maturana &#8211; from Alonso y Pedrajo &#8211; was the bottled sunset we never had, aglow with hot-skinned peachy fruits, a mouthful of layers, luxurious but not a jot heavy. Alas, the external conditions were rainy and windy, but had the beach beckoned, I would have been down there in a flash brandishing this wonderous amber wine solaire! Props to the Maturana grape!<a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-23-at-12.33.26-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11442" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-23-at-12.33.26-PM.png" alt="" width="477" height="450" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-23-at-12.33.26-PM.png 558w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-23-at-12.33.26-PM-300x283.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In retrospect, the best holiday wines refresh the soul and the thirst in equal measure. They are agile in the sense of bending between delightful frivolity whilst maintaining a smack of seriousness. Holidays should be a vacation from taste, a kind of mental rejuvenation in which drinking wines that accord with one’s celebratory mood, is the order of the day.</span></p>
<h3><b>Isn’t Burgundy expensive?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">… is a rhetorical question uttered by those in the wine trade. The answer is that it is. Ridiculously so. I only realised this when I was in a restaurant the other week and felt like ordering a classic linear Chardonnay from the Beaune. When I looked at the price on the (reasonably price list) of my preferred bottle, my courage (i.e. my wallet) failed me and my resolve dissipated. Certain regions are now officially beyond my pocket. I assume others have the same experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel that these prices have crept up over the years without me noticing and whilst we take wine inflation for granted the increases are in a category of their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is understandable that this should be the case with the succession of catastrophic climatic events. Lack of supply and high demand means that prices will inevitably climb, but we have reached where merely good wines have become a rare treat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not being a varietal junkie, don’t tell me that Australian or Chilean Chardonnay is a great alternative, because (whisper it loudly) – I don’t desperately need to drink Chardonnay for better or worse, for richer or poorer. Beautiful Chardonnay may be made in various countries, but to get the near the quality level of a cracking Burgundy, you would be forking out a very tidy sum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where can we find liquid bang for our buck? That’s a whole article in itself, however, Spain and Portugal and the Med islands, the Languedoc and Greece and southern Italy are reliable sources for excellent yet inexpensive wine. South Africa and Australia deserve mention. It is worth assaying grape varieties (and blends) that – thank goodness – are not yet in fashion. Every wine on its merits and according to the value (in pleasure) that it yields.</span></p>
<h3><b>Slaves to the new machine</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ai is a three-toed South American sloth. A useful out word in the game of Lexicon too. AI is a different beast. I was mailed a survey today enquiring in what ways and to what extent our company uses AI in the way we conduct business. The questions were posed in such a quasi-reverent jargonistic way as to suggest that AI was a super positive tool in terms of analytics, marketing, stock control etc and it would be astonishing if our company had not already made a wholesale conversion in our practices to accommodate its benefits. I don’t believe it marks me out as a luddite if what distinguishes one business from another is its capacity to look beyond the numbers to create relationships. Call it business empathy or the personal touch, making our decisions on a human level. We spend way too much already buried in spreadsheets and charts, analysing data every which way, when we should be generating trade the old-fashioned way. Software talking to software is not as efficient as human beings talking to human beings, there being questions and personal recommendations and peculiar circumstances.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best holiday wines refresh the soul and the thirst in equal measure. They are agile in the sense of bending between delightful frivolity whilst maintaining a smack of seriousness.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a useful tool, AI is bruited by consultants. Which is perverse because AI will sooner or later make their jobs redundant. The government also rhapsodises about advanced technology in the workplace, which must necessarily mean that it is the Emperor’s New Clothes. They believe so devoutly that it is some form of magic bullet, pinning their hopes that it will solve many of our social problems in the way that something you don’t understand fully must be cutting edge (because you don’t understand it fully!). AI is not the solution and is very probably the problem, a statement bound to get me zapped by Skynet. And quite possibly an existential problem as evidenced by the boiling cesspit that is social media and the way that algorithms are being used to target certain sectors of society. One can say, of course, that it is not the conduit (that is, the never-ending production and parsing of data) that is at fault, but rather the sewage that flows through it. Those that manipulate AI most certainly hold the tools of power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a lesser way, in the world of wine, whereas modified versions of AI may have some useful applications, human contact (at all levels) still defines the nature of our industry. Which revolves around service and hospitality. Wine is a tactile, pleasure-giving substance, its growers farm the land and have a relationship with their vines, buyers taste the wines, assess them, express a preference, buy them, and then communicate the “human” story to their customers. The grape juice lives in these constant human interactions.</span></p>

<h3><b>Wine love stats</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got a little list (or several). Read any wine magazine article and it will bristle with stats. These are cited to show us what is trending (grape variety, region, country etc). Such figures may be massaged to prove a point. What influences individual is more complex than reading about a trend and jumping on a bandwagon (albeit some people will do that). Our drinking habits are determined by a combination of personal recommendations, affordability, social media/influencers, weather, mood, and existing personal preference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are my stats – but please look back at your own experiences, analyse what you are drinking, and see what floats your boat, and why.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I taste and drink/share around 300 bottles of wine per year (excluding wine tastings)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">99% of those consumed are natural or low intervention wines (which is my preference).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of these might be termed “middle of the road” natural.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These comprise approximately 60% white wines, 20% orange/rose, 10% sparkling, 10% red.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All wines served, having been chilled to a certain extent.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal evaluation</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps half a dozen wines yield epiphanies/near epiphanies. These are beautiful wines that take one on a journey. These wines are different each year, but the appreciation involves many stars aligning!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 may be deemed “excellent”, in the sense they present as wholesome, nourishing, and vibrate with good energy. I notice these wines keenly and want to communicate the pleasure they afford me.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">150 are good to very good. The bottle is finished easily. Each mouthful is solid and offers a degree of pleasure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 are good but not memorable. They serve their purpose. One wouldn’t necessarily drink them again and they are quickly forgotten.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 are competent/ordinary. Nothing wrong with the wines but am unable to finish the bottle. And that is the test of a truly enjoyable wine.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly 10 bottles are faulty. Out of these, perhaps 2 are corked, 2 show VA beyond my tolerance level, and the remainder present mousiness in varying degrees.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trending for me: Sparkling wines (especially grower champagne). Serious rosé wines (more colour, more structure). Wines made from grapes grown on limestone. Trending for me is a pretentious way of saying “wines that I generally like to drink at the moment.” These are a few of my favourite thing, therefore, and my tastes are as capricious as my moods.</span></p>
<h3><b>“Wine and politics don’t mix”</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We used to hear that sport and politics should be kept apart. Yet, boycotting is a tool that was often used successfully in the past to put pressure on regimes in repressive countries. Unfortunately, these days, money talks louder than principles in all sports and sportswashing is commonplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every decision, be in personal life or business, is a matter of political choice. The inconvenient truth emerges when you examine whom you deal with and how you conduct your own business on a micro level. It is traditional (and some would say, natural) to see the point of business for the profit of the company and the people who work within it. It is an entirely different mindset to put ethics first and business after that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is customary to talk about political will and the need for governments to operate by best example. Yet, the climate crisis we talk about is the very choice of governments who have allowed industrial polluters to lobby them and water down remedial policies for reasons of financial expediency. It is the choice of those who vote these backsliders into power again and again, selfishly deciding short-term gain is more important than the real welfare of the planet. Every choice we make, consequently, is a political one in the final analysis – even if we choose to say and do nothing. In the wine sector, sustainability, environmental conscientiousness and regenerative farming matter because there will be no wine industry in the future unless we work together with these core principles in mind. Farmers, importers, and more importantly, consumers, can help to set a more progressive ethical agenda since market forces in a capitalistic society are the most powerful drivers for change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Auditing each and every of one’s business transaction on an ethical basis is tricky and contentious. If you are exporting (or importing) wines, then you may well be selling into  &#8211; or buying from &#8211; countries with a record of repressing human rights, committing genocide, or engaged in a cruel war. Where is the moral line in the sand? After all, countries that were former democracies are now also perpetrating crimes in all but name against their own citizens as well as those of other countries. Do we also hold the people of a country and our potential trading partners accountable for the actions of those that govern them? Politics involves making uncomfortable decisions that work against one’s self interest, but if you compromise your standards because doing the right thing is inconvenient, then you cannot claim to hold a moral position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be dealing with individuals in business whose personal behaviour and ethics are the opposite of yours. Who are we to judge? Yet,  rather than reserving judgement, in the end, one simply can’t sit on the fence and not call out bad behaviour when it occurs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wish to change the world even in a little way, you need to develop a moral compass. This has to be said with all humility. None of us are perfect, morality is rarely black or white, and if you can’t make a living then you won’t have a business that can generate potentially positive outcomes. Adhering to the principle of recognising the ethical implications of each business decision, as well as improving the work environment within one’s own company, is a beginning. Start with positive changes that can be managed near home &#8211; and then work outwards. The central tenet is this: business can have a higher function other than existing for its own good; it can work on behalf of others &#8211; if the way that it is conducted is ethical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We therefore need to observe The Golden Rule and put it at the forefront of business transactions. Whether or not it materially benefits us, it sets an example to others, and that is a meaningful political statement.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.weingut-beck.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Beck winery</a> is a family estate in Gols, in northern Burgenland near lake Neusiedl. Traditionally, there were small mixed farms in the area, but they always grew vines as part of the agricultural diversity. In 1975 Matthias Beck took over from his father and started to focus on wine only, they started with 5 ha. Today the Beck estate has 15 ha of vines. In 2001 Judith took over responsibility for the cellar after gaining experience in France, Italy and Chile. In 2007 the conversion to biodynamic viticulture was started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone like Judith Beck lives not just according to a postal address, but actually amidst the vines, then you can be sure that she’s developed a deep relationship to her own vineyards. The most beautiful of these vines – she prefers the traditional varieties Zweigelt, Blaufränkisch, St. Laurent, Weissburgunder and Chardonnay – lie on the slopes and the hills of the Wagram. This is the name of the area of slopes which are, for the most part, sun-exposed and rise from the lowlands east of the Neusiedlersee to the so-called Parndorfer Platte.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soils here are extremely diverse. In fact, a single vineyard alone can comprise humus, gravel, loam, limestone and minerals – the ideal basis for complex, multi-faceted wines that reflect their origin. Naturalness and identity are the features that Judith wants to see and to show in her wines. This approach is also a reason that she has been inspired by the ideas of Rudolf Steiner since 2007. That means she uses holistic methods in her biologically-managed vineyards in order to keep the vines naturally healthy. This includes greening, care for biodiversity, fertilizing with biological humus. Working by hand, consideration of the moon cycles and more. Consequently, Judith does not add cultured yeasts, but instead “risks” allowing her wines to ferment spontaneously – in other words, truly naturally.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Beck-IMG_9649.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11433" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Beck-IMG_9649.jpg" alt="" width="926" height="617" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Beck-IMG_9649.jpg 1350w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Beck-IMG_9649-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Beck-IMG_9649-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Beck-IMG_9649-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 926px) 100vw, 926px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her wines are in the best sense natural, genuine and, above all, authentic. Always more discreet than loud. Always worth a “second look”. In her own words: “International style can be produced by everyone, everywhere. My wines are my own. They are here and now. And that is, for me, the most beautiful thing. Like my life in the vineyards”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bambule range of whites (all made with skin contact) and reds (vibrant and crunchy)  are tonic wines, with a lively lingering purity. Bambule! as well as referring to the range of wines made without filtration or added sulphur, is an expression of freedom, a desire to push boundaries and discover something new and vital in wine and through winemaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soils here (for the Furmint) are gravelly with a very good drainage on a gentle south-west facing slope at 175 m altitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furmint, when Burgenland was still part of Hungary, was an important grape variety in the environs of Lake Neusiedl. It was used mainly for the production of sweet wines. After the collapse of the monarchy, the variety fell into oblivion. In 2017,  Judith planted a small vineyard of Furmint, which they considered a very interesting variety because of its marked acid structure. It also had a pronounced aroma and a certain &#8220;fieriness&#8221;, which is a counterpart to the acidity.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bambule range of whites and reds are tonic wines, with a lively lingering purity. They&#8217;re made without filtration or added sulphur; expressions of freedom, a desire to push boundaries and discover something new and vital in wine and through winemaking.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grapes are hand harvested, destemmed and undergo five days of maceration in open top stainless-steel vat before ambient fermentation in old tonneaux with indigenous yeast and a further period of ageing in used barrels of 500 litres. The wine completes malolactic fermentation and is bottled without filtration, fining or added sulphites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Furmint Bambule has vibrant aromas of green apple, quince, and citrus zest, balanced by subtle floral notes and a distinct minerality, culminating in a crisp, refreshing finish that highlights its lively acidity and complexity. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always subscribed to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">notion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that low/no sulphur wines would be more invigorating, more digestible than more conventional added-sulphite wines. Despite this romantic feeling, I always reserved a portion of healthy scientific perspective. What if adding sulphites might benefit the wine in question? Were my preferences purely a matter of degree and totally a matter of taste?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, that relative open-mindedness was knocked for six. I opened a bottle of wine that hitherto I had revered and respected. Lowish (I thought) in sulphites. From an extraordinary place, a magical vineyard. A living liquid fragment of history. How eager I was to crack a bottle, and how predisposed I was to love the wine! The taste? It’s good. No more. Not exciting. Not as good as I remember. The wine lacks energy. Each sip begins to drag. I am now not enjoying it and forcing myself to drink. I feel the wine rasping, slowly burning on my tongue, making me flush. I feel profound disappointment. Was it always like this? Is my memory suddenly trying to cash cheques that reality cannot honour?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, tastes change. Palates are reconfigured. And how!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am not relating this anecdote as a confirmed no-sulphur nazi, but as someone who has always wanted to love every sup and gulp that he consumes. My passion is pleasure in whatever form it takes. Were a conventional wine to transport me with delight, I would be broadcasting its merits on all media channels. What I am tasting now is flavour that has been scalped. A wine irredeemably bruised by overly cautious intervention. As mentioned,  the wine that is currently puckering my taste buds, might be considered at the low-to-moderate-end of the sulphite addition. I may be super-sensitive – the result of drinking no-lo for so long that my palate has been calibrated to reject even the slightest of sulphite-y nuances, or it may be that if others taste what I taste, then this is indeed an addition too much and too far.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel the wine rasping, slowly burning on my tongue, making me flush. I feel profound disappointment. Was it always like this?</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s difficult to describe the joys of truly liberated wines. Words rarely wield the matter. The language of feeling is so personal to the taster in question. I can, however, describe the many ways in which wines fall short of my expectations, like a guy in a HM Bateman-style cartoon who points out the apparent deficiencies in a wine that everyone else is bowing down to.  I may be the very odd-one-out in terms of taste. I am sure though that I am not the only one hyper-sensitive to superimposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be instructive to look at examples of responses to sulphur-added versus no-sulphite wine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who attended the book launch of <a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/2017/02/21/an-evening-with-jean-pierre-frick-fresh-air-in-the-natural-wine-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jean-Pierre Frick’s Du Vin! De L’Air! at Terroirs</a> nearly a decade ago, were treated to a blind tasting of two wines that were identical in every respect, other than one had had a homeopathic quantity of sulphites added and the other had none. Jean-Pierre asked us which we thought was the no-sulphur and which was the other, and which we preferred. We had no idea, other than what was in the glass. 45 people in the room voted unanimously for one wine – it was, as it happened, the no-sulphite wine and it was the one they preferred. This was not a scientific experiment, and I am aware that an anecdote does not count as data, but Jean-Pierre was surprised that each individual person was in accord in their relative responses to the wines. For me, this was a revelation – the flavour and texture gulf between the wines seemed enormous, yet the difference was down to a mere 20 parts per million added to one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we were solely informed by wine science, then deductively-speaking the cleaner, more precise of the two wines would surely be the one with added sulphites. Because sulphur is a preservative and a corrective. In fact, the opposite was the case in this demonstration, and following their instincts, all the tasters “felt” that one wine was evidently more resonant and more alive than the other. In fact, the presence of sulphites had had a deadening impact and affected our perception of the wine.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I am tasting now is flavour that has been scalped. A wine irredeemably bruised by overly cautious intervention.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My chief (and simple) alimentary desire is for a wine to be digestible. Difficult to describe exactly what this constitutes other than to say that the wine that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feels</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good to you, will taste nourishing and vital and sit easily on your stomach. In the Frick tasting, I opted for the wine that I wanted to drink and presumed (and hoped) it was the natural wine. It was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having consumed such a wine, you may also feel good about yourself. Take a little wine for thy stomach’s sake (1 Timothy 5:23), counsels the apostle Paul in the Bible. Whenever I select a wine to drink at a given moment, this quality (digestibility) will be the foremost consideration, and when I drink, if the wine is not slipping down naturally and effortlessly (and does feel like it is doing me good), then the bottle does not get finished. The opposite of digestibility is confection, dullness, and lack of inner balance. Although I would not claim to be a great taster, instinctively I recoil when confronted with wines that are marked by additives and winemaking tropes. The rejection is not an intellectual one, it is very much physical. The same applies to aversive reactions to food or other drinks which also contain a lot of additives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, one’s body becomes conditioned to reject what it perceives to be unhealthy. That may be down to individual tolerance &#8211; and I am at one end of the response-spectrum. One may speculate that many long-term health problems and modern illnesses arise from ingesting concentrations of chemicals in food (the result of bad farming practice) and from wine (and other beverages). As food and drink is processed, even more chemicals may be added. Such denatured products are neither nourishing for the soul nor good for the body. One argument goes that the homeopathic use of sulphites and other chemical additions to wine will not significantly affect our health. This ignores the pattern of consumption of wine and food and the resultant slow accumulation of these (toxic) substances. Not to mention the considerable reduction of the presence of those bacteria that help us to ward off chronic health conditions.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">45 people in the room voted unanimously for one wine – it was, as it happened, the no-sulphite wine and it was the one they preferred. </span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the health arguments, I am not, of course, saying that all natural wines are wonderful to drink. Each wine must be considered on its merits, always, and inferior examples of all types of wine will exist, be they conventional or natural. However, when you taste a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sans sulphite</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wine that is in perfect condition, you seem to enter a different realm of flavour. Wine drinkers are rarely of a type. Whereas I find myself drinking within the narrowest spectrum of wine styles, others may possess more catholic taste and accept both conventional and natural wines without fear or favour, and yet others would not touch a natural wine (if they knew it to be one) with a bargepole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to today, and to wines that I have tasted over the past year or two and am now reassessing. If I was ever previously shy about expressing my love of low-no-sulphite added wines, I am not anymore. There is a tipping point in every wine &#8211; and in every wine journey &#8211; wherein one feels that the balance of a wine is irrevocably disturbed by awkward intervention. I can’t say for certain that the wine I am tasting in this case would be better with no (or fewer) added sulphites, but I can assert that it has been deprived of a certain quality. Liveliness, energy, naturalness – these are absent (and these qualities are so important &#8211; to me). How a wine makes me feel is critical to my enjoyment and appreciation of it. If the wine lacks the aforementioned properties, I find it almost impossible to drink it. Having erred for years on the side of reasonableness, I should probably own my preference for no-sulphite added wine, which, doubtless, is the result of consuming thousands of wines over the years and ultimately recognising what agrees with me and coming to terms with it. Not that I am not imposing my choices on others…</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stefano Bellotti understood farming and the language of nature at a fundamental level. He made wines that were wild, long-lived and spoke deeply of their origins. He was the spirit of real appellation and fought hard to maintain the integrity of that word, often finding himself deeply at odds with bureaucracy. He was a kind of wine-poet and warrior-philosopher and inspired huge devotion amongst those who knew him intimately. Stefano produced fine wines respectful of nature for more than forty years. His <a href="https://www.cascinadegliulivi.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cascina degli Ulivi</a> was a true polycultural endeavour, a self-sufficient farm, growing vegetables and cereals, breeding animals for milk, meat and eggs, and making bread and cheese. His legacy is assured, and the estate is now run by his daughter, Ilaria, with a young, dynamic, and international team, the perfect blend of veterans and new talent. Stefano would be immensely proud. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agricultural product is a flower that blossoms from the encounter of love between the creativity of nature and that of man.  ~ Stefano Bellotti</span></i></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stefano left Genoa in his late teens. He was always attracted to the rural life and returned to the tiny abandoned family farm originally purchased by his parents after the war in Novi Ligure. Noticing that the vines were thriving he chose to make his living through wine predominantly but also to combine that with closed farm approach with a vegetable garden and orchard, ancient varieties of cereals and spelt and to keep ducks, chickens, donkeys, cattle and a horse. At this time (the late 70s) farming throughout Italy had become increasingly influenced by chemical and industrial methods, something Stefano, in his desire to return to more peasant ways, eschewed. By 1981 he was working organically, very much in isolation, as there was no organic movement at the time, no exemplars to follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1984, Stefano was introduced to biodynamics and realised that this was the most effective method of farming if he wanted to achieve better results in the vineyard. For him it was a model of common sense that “takes the conscience of the earth and the plant”. Bellotti, the political philosopher, believed that the post-war economic model was built on industrialisation, was predicated on productivity (for the sake of productivity) and venerated materialism, and that the tenets of smallholder farming were forgotten about or dismissed. “It was a time where people were being too Cartesian, and biodynamic agriculture lent itself to a vision of a world that couldn’t be controlled by science; it was too much of a free spirit to work in a model based on uniformity and productivity. So biodynamic farmers became the minority of the minority. And because these farmers were going out of their way to pursue this style of agriculture, they were billed as esoteric, as sorcerers, as part of a sect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stefano focused on bringing as much biodiversity as he could to the land in order to promote a healthy soil and developed a rotation system where certain rows of vines were left alone in order to give the soil the opportunity to revitalise itself. Biodynamic preps were used to encourage microbial activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for winemaking he once said in an interview: “Humans don’t make wines: microorganisms do. This is a sacred world we don’t understand anything about!</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever I drink this wine, I feel that it is a form of revolution in a glass. Ornery, invincible, perfectly imperfect.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stefano believed that farming was an act of political will.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two wines are especially worth the detour. An old vines co-planted parcel in Filagnotti comprising Timorasso, Verdea, Bosco, Riesling Italico and Chasselas is responsible for the field blend called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Demûa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a wine fermented and aged for nine months on grape skins with the traditional submerged cap technique (and then aged for a further two months on the fine lees). A truly elegant wine with a complex nose suggesting white fruits, rosemary and orange zest; a dry and elegant wine, with a long finish. “Such a versatile wine. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Demûa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “the enjoyment” in Genovese dialect, fits with any occasion; it’s the white wine of winter and the red wine of summer. After this very long maceration, the tannins are very tight and fine at the same time, making it highly drinkable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever I drink this wine, I feel that it is a form of revolution in a glass. Ornery, invincible, perfectly imperfect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The superb </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filagnotti </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(named after Stefano’s dog who adorns the label), a naturally-fermented Cortese from a vineyard with iron-red clay soils, is golden and laden with exotic lees spice. Fermented and refined in 25 hl acacia barrels for 15-months. In Stefano’s own words “it has a unique personality, totally recognisable and straightforward. A very determined wine, that walks ahead like someone who knows where he’s going; it develops its complexity all along a same common thread. It has an almost metallic minerality that makes me think of the rock band from the 70’s, “Iron Butterfly”. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida</span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">indeed.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stefano believed that farming was an act of political will</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stefano’s wines have always been deeply rooted in the local living soils and specific climate. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filagnotti</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is remarkably intense with the ferrous minerality typical of this vineyard. It has layers of aromas and flavours that are truly seductive.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Georgian supra is so much more than eating and drinking. It is a form of nourishment for the soul, an affirmation of the civilising effect of the meal taken in company.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8423" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8423" style="width: 895px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_3362.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-8423" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_3362.jpg" alt="" width="895" height="895" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_3362.jpg 1174w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_3362-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_3362-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_3362-768x768.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_3362-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8423" class="wp-caption-text"><em>One of several Georgian Surpras in the basement of Terroirs wine bar (RIP)</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ritual becomes the romance when observers of ceremony become participants in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the fact of being in Georgia and experiencing these things make the wine taste more special? There is a cliché to the effect that wine tastes better in its place of origin. Or is it the sheer points of difference that excite, such as the unusual composition of the wine, originating from strange (to us) often unpronounceable grape varieties, and made in a unique way in buried terracotta pots? Is it the oddness of the occasion – especially for those of us who tend to analyse a wine methodically – in that participating in a ritual makes us altogether less critical? Are unaccustomed feelings of gratitude and surprise seasoning our taste buds? When the qvevri is being opened, the producer often makes a little speech laced with solemnity, good humour, and best wishes. And we, witnesses to a form of wine baptism, drink in the symbolism of the moment. Our subsequent surprise and delight (if we have never been exposed to such an experience previously) may manifest in a gasp of pleasure, mouthing or uttering of “wow”, an impulse to laugh. Being in the company of others who are reacting in a similar way, further heightens our response.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the qvevri is being opened, the producer often makes a little speech laced with solemnity, good humour, and best wishes. And we, witnesses to a form of wine baptism, drink in the symbolism of the moment.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surprise response is a fleeting mental and physiological reaction. Our unfamiliarity with other cultural traditions will usually leave us open to this reaction. The next stage in the experience is to engage with what is happening. The supra, for example, in which the tamada takes us on an intellectual and emotional journey, involves a series of short speeches and toasts, during which our tongues (and inhibitions) are loosened over the course of the feast. The toasts are often in honour of us. Eating, drinking and laughing together is the ultimate social communion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder also if wine tastes better when you abandon reasoned responses and dive deep into the pleasure of the moment. At one particular  supra, a friend and I were given cow horns filled to the brim with wine, with the injunction to link arms and drain the drink to its dregs. As the torrent of liquid gushed into my mouth and I swallowed, I experienced a brief glorious sensation of release. The wine literally did not touch my lips. It was liquid silk, filling me with the spirit of the feast. For not tasting it, the wine never tasted better. And never would. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wine has been used for thousands of years as a libation when a liquid is ritually poured as an offering to a deity or spirit, or in memory of the dead. It was common in many religions of antiquity and continues to be offered in cultures today. In modern times, this ritual, in the form of the (usually secular) toast, punctuates a meal or bookends a solemn sentiment. In many cases, the toasts hasten drunkenness, in others they are to remind us that (before we become very drunk), we should celebrate the company of friends and give thanks for the occasion. The emotional honesty, the wit and warm humour, the clever use of metaphysical conceits is a universal language that we enjoy and respect. Ingesting the wine without analysis is the furlough from good taste that even professional tasters need at times. The words flow, the wine flows &#8211; fellow feeling is engendered.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the terms that wine professionals frequently “deploy” in conversation amongst one another is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">terroir</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although it can also be used when referring to food or the rootedness of the cuisine of a particular place. Technically speaking, it is a shorthand term to describe the particularities of climate, aspect and soil, those geographical and geological features that influence the nature of the wine itself. Terroir is regarded as the unique imprint of the vineyard carried into the very flavour of the wine, the idea being that we are able to taste the terroir when we are drinking the wine. And that a wine conveys terroir is considered a positive attribute; it gives it the ring of authenticity and makes it stand out from the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This assumes that terroir is transmitted into wines in a way that allows us to identify what it is bringing to the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When comparing two or more wines from the same grape variety from different vineyards which have different physical properties,  obvious differences may be detected. I am not sure one even needs to be a specially skilled taster to do this. When we are comparing things that we know are not the same, we tend to look more closely for these differences (and usually find them). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever we taste a wine, it presents a range of aromas and flavours that we perceive uniquely and proceed to describe in a way that relates to our experience. Often we sense a quality in the wine that is difficult to put into words, and we might like to characterise as terroir, that sense of origin which has not been obscured by intrusive winemaking (for example). Even if we don’t know where it comes from or how it arises, we perceive it in terms of “minerality”. Whatever that means, indeed. Minerality is such a common descriptor in tasting notes that we cannot ignore. Whether a wine can physically possess this intrinsic property” or whether we are tasting something else is the question that scientists understandably wish to pose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamie Goode writes in Wine Anorak:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sense of place is an abstract property: it is something we learn to associate with a wine where that wine has distinctive flavour that is unique to that place. And where white and red grape varieties are grown in adjacent plots, even if the soil is homogeneous, the resulting wines are usually completely different, yet we might consider both to express a sense of place, even though they have little in common.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wines are different for innumerable reasons. The grapes matter, the vines matter, the soils matter, the farming matters, the locale matters, the yeasts matter, and of course, the process matters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument is that terroir is a concept that we apply to wines of a certain place and not an inherent property of the wine-in-that-place and that where it creates distinctiveness in wine, it does so in subtle and indirect ways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This view further posits that we may be tasting chemicals and a combination of aromatised flavours which interact with a part of our memory and the area of the brain that is trained to recognise flavours and equate them with certain wines. Said aromas and flavours may come from the grapes themselves, the yeasts and bacteria present in the must, or from various chemical and microbiological reactions that take place during the transformation and maturation of the wine, or from the elevage itself in whatever vessel the wine undergoes this process in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disregarding the taster’s unique palate and experience, these are what makes the wine taste the way that it does. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I submit that we are able to discern whether the wine possesses the characteristics of certain minerals, of climate and vintage, and yes, even the soils in which the vines grow</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we talk of terroir, we are not speaking of exact flavours but the fugitive (or distinct) impression we have of minerality that we imagine derives from the soil. Science suggests that these minerals are present at very low concentrations in the wine, yet we seem to be able to detect them and describe the corresponding sensation of minerality. In other words, wines from grapes grown on limestone (or granite or basaltic soils) don’t necessarily taste of those exact stones, and yet we receive mineral impressions (in salt form) of the self-same soil types.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is true that there are other factors in play as well as the topographical elements and the nature of the soils. The water and the environment (biosphere) affect the very nature of the vine and the grapes that grow on it.  If the vine changes because of the soil and the environment, so does the wine. Isn’t this part of what terroir is?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say a winemaker who has farmed organically begins to spray the vines with chemicals or apply chemical fertilisers over successive vintage, does this not affect the relationship between the soil and the vines, and the consequent expression of terroir?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another argument goes that growers change the methods of winemaking to suit the perception of the terroir. Perhaps. Those who farm the vines best understand the terroir of their vineyards. They appreciate where the vines thrive, and which parcels give the finest expression of place. They are bound to be careful, treat the grapes with respect, and use the most sensitive winemaking methods in order not to obscure the latent properties of the grapes and indeed bring out and exalt those qualities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipping the argument, how is it that tasters, experienced or otherwise, can detect clear differences between wines made from grapes grown on vines on specific soil types? When we talk about terroir, we are usually referring to a prevailing soil characteristic. When growers come over to do tastings or organise presentations, they often bring a collection of stones or jars filled with soil to illustrate what the roots of the vines have their feet in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are we tasting when we say we taste terroir, and why are we tasting it? Are we somehow inferring the terroir from a necessarily limited menu of options and from random chemical flavours that somehow correspond (taste wise) with the soil type wherein the grapes originate? Or is it that many and varied elements conspire together to convey the impression of terroir are more pronounced in these wines?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When blind tasting, I submit that we are able to discern whether the wine possesses the characteristics of certain minerals, of climate and vintage, and yes, even the soils in which the vines grow. If you have prior knowledge of these things, then the process of identification of such properties may be easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terroir is more than rocks. Soils is made up of a mixture of organic material, minerals, gases, water, and organisms, that together support the life of the plants. The soil feeds the vine and gives it life. Rather than thinking what is the rock type, we should be asking what the nature of the life in the soil is, and how it impacts the vines and ultimately the wine that is made from the grapes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grower is equally part of the terroir, both influenced by the landscape and influencing it in innumerable ways. They may intimately understand not just one parcel or block of vines or a row, but even a single vine &#8211; and how it performs. They know how to prune, how to train vines, what measures to take in and around the vines. This sensitivity is designed to enhance terroir expression. Whether it does or not, it indicates that many growers have a clear feeling for what their vineyards are capable of.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">F.A.W.M., as I refer to it, is not a gastronomic art form that interests me greatly. I wouldn’t say that I was an iconoclast in these matters, but it does seem that many take matching seriously and view it as a form of wine expertise. It is true that we are often asked to create wine lists that are (notionally) ideally sympathetic to the cuisine in question, including some perfect matches. Of course, there is no manifesto or code of conduct for matching, more like broad guidelines, but the question “what would you recommend with the salmon”. I would try a red wine and scrape the ruined remains of 007 off the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept (for it is a concept) of wine and food matching revolves around the process of pairing dishes with wine in a way designed to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">enhance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (my italics) the dining </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">experience</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (my italics). In some cases, this will be very carefully thought out by the matcher (a sommelier or wine writer, for example), and will amount to an aesthetic deliberation weighing up all the flavours, seasonings, and textures in play to ensure clashes do not take place and a form of harmonious liaison is arrived at, exalting the dance of dishes and drinks, the effortless gastronomic rhythm that emerges from echoes and contrasts, points and counterpoints. Flavour combination here is seen as an art, engaging both the intellect and the emotions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did we get here? In many cultures, wine has been (and is) a simple constant at the dining table and, as a result, the winemaking and culinary traditions of a particular region have evolved together over the years. Rather than following fixed rules, therefore, local cooking is often paired with the local wines. Which makes sense. On the one hand, availability dictates what is eaten and drunk, and the flavours of regional food and drink are shaped by the same climate and the environment. Seasonality plays a further part. Gastronomy is this fusion of tradition and place in the cooking and winemaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am not fond, for everyday at least, of racy, heady wines that diffuse a potent charm and have their own particular flavour. What I like best is a clean, light, modest country vintage of no special name. One can carry plenty of it and it has a good and homely flavour of the land, and of the earth and sky and woods”.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211;Steppenwolf</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pure table wine, such as it is, possibly served in a jug, has no label or provenance or expectations. It is what it is. It is usually in the background, as an accompaniment, occasionally it takes centre stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One can imagine that before appellation existed, or wines were judged worthy and accountable, wine was a rough and rustic drink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although over-earnest allegiance to local rules can be limiting!</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I visited Eric Narioo while he was living in Tuscany. On the first night he drove us to a restaurant in the hills. The tiny road wound through the forest and eventually we parked near the top of the hill. There was no sign of any restaurant, giving rise to that faint sense of Blair Witch Project dread that transpires when you are wandering around lost in the dark woods. As if to add to the Grimm’s fairy tale scenario, the sound of furious barking commenced, presumably from the resident evil hounds of Baskerville straining at their leashes. At last the restaurant itself, a large cabin in a clearing perched on the edge of the mountain, hove into sight.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight wild boars roasted whole at breakfast, but twelve persons there.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211;Romeo &amp; Juliet</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We sat down, the only customers in the joint, and were presented with the menu. A large menu. A large menu of meat. A large menu of meat exclusively devoted to pork. So, we ordered some pork, followed by some pork. With an intermezzo of pappardelle. Which was coated in a nice ragu of pork. Our genial host came to proffer us the wine list, whilst bearing a large plate. An extra course, an amuse-bouche, if you like. It was thick-cut, fatty wild boar salami – to tantalise our palates and get the juices flowing.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the end of May and very warm outside. We definitely needed something refreshing to drink. Eric looked at the list, eyes widening. He even looked at the back page, which was empty, to make certain.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where are the white wines?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t have any white wines until summer, sir.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it is 25 degrees!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer doesn’t officially start until June.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I laughed to myself, fondly imagining that the food menu changed on June 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a winter pork selection to a summer pork one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric grabbed the wine list again. He ordered a bottle of Barbera and then shrugged. Shall we go for it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shrugged too. Why not?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bottle of Masseto 1997, please.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002006/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If they want to drink Merlot, we&#8217;re drinking Merlot. </span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0316079/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miles Raymond</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: No, if anyone orders Merlot, I&#8217;m leaving. I am NOT drinking any fucking Merlot! </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;Sideways</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were drinking a fucking 200% Merlot, and we didn’t care, because we were marooned in the restaurant equivalent of The Overlook Hotel, trying to cure our pork-eater’s block. This was also the time of one’s life that research meant drinking the finest wines available to humanity. And when in Tuscany-shire, don’t drink what you would normally drink, nor even what the locals would drink, but strap in and drink bombastic Super-Tuscans whilst laughing at the absurdity of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We eventually staggered out of the restaurant, pork-witted bumblers, Falstaffian to a degree. I was that “stuffed cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly,” craving a plate of shrimp and a big slug of heavily-chilled tangy Vermentino. Which I would also more than gladly have gulped with the above-mentioned porkathon.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">When in Tuscany-shire, don’t drink what you would normally drink, nor even what the locals would drink, but strap in and drink bombastic Super-Tuscans whilst laughing at the absurdity of the world.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may be taking regionality and blind seasonality to an extreme, but if you go to a lot of restaurants in France, Italy and Spain (for example) you will probably experience a similar adherence to the idea that local wines should be served with local food, whatever the weather. One of the unwritten rules that I learned from the above experience is that wines with less obvious intensity are more malleable and offer the kind of digestibility that best accompanies heavy meals and showpiece wines dance solo (and not very well).</span></p>

<h2><b>The art of matching</b></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of early food and wine matching advice from a wine merchant in (the caves of) Lascaux:</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bison with white wine, Mastodon with red wine.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oberon Kant’s Big Book of Wine</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, let’s pretend to play the game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as there is choice, food and wine matching becomes a more complex exercise. The variables are limitless. Different elements need to be considered in each dish. Many dishes attempt to find a balance between salty, sweet, sour and umami. Food and wine experts believe that the most basic element of food and wine pairing is understanding how the &#8220;weight&#8221; of the food and the body of the wine might go together.  On top of this, the very approach to cooking – from roasting, grilling, steaming and poaching, to seasoning and spicing, transform the flavour and texture of the original ingredients. Wines are not a single note either. Some have basic and obvious fruit flavours, others will have a spicy quality. Lees ageing, oak maturation, ph/acidity and mineral saltiness and, of course, tannin, will impact the flavour matching. It is not sufficient to assert that Sangiovese will work well with a specific dish, when a vast range of styles of wines are made from this single variety.  The wine itself may not even be a constant variable in the matching equation. After all, the temperature, the type of glass, even the weather may serve to enhance or diminish its aromas. Finally, there is the human element. As we know, different individuals have different levels of sensitivity to acidity, tannin, sweetness and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A banquet, wherein multiple dishes are served at the same time, presents a still further challenge. If you are served the one wine, you will drink the one wine. Many wine drinkers will also choose on instinct, the mood of the meal, or simply want to drink a particular wine at a particular moment. The subjective nature of taste makes it possible to drink any kind of wine with any kind of food and have an enjoyable experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eating and drinking is sequential. In other words, when I put a forkful of food in my mouth, I don’t drink wine at the same time. Drinking is more of a sluicing procedure. Wine obsessives might, of course, taste the wine prior to eating. The flavours of food should be contemplated separately to the flavours of wine. If the food is good and the wine is good, that is all that matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wine experts and advocates in the realm of food and wine pairing prefer to focus on the more objective physical aspects of food that have an effect on the palate, altering (or enhancing) the perception of various aspects of the wine. Matches are the holy grail in that they are not so elusive, they require that one is fully tuned into both food and wine.  The magic happens when everything </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">seems</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> perfect. The best wines will dance with the food without treading upon the flavours &#8211; or being trodden on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s leave this subject with the aphorism: “If the wine is good, however, a bad match will not destroy dinner.”</span></p>
<h2><b>“Perfection”</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all done it – bought way too much Comte cheese on a whim and a prayer knowing that back at the ranch a cheeky clavelin bottle of Vin Jaune, lurking dustily on the bottom row of the wine rack, has been beckoning you to match its sotolony pleasures with a well-matured cheese from the homeland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is more than a match, for goodness sake; it is the bloody sacrament! You feel immediately impelled to post this righteous gastronomic combination on all social media channels before you have even pulled the cork. You’ve been “jaunesing” for this, the patience (yours) with the patient ageing of the cheese in its cellar and the equally slow gently oxidative maturation wine under flor, that 0h-so-precious thick yeasty veil. The alpha wine poseur meets alpha-ketobutyric acid. Those who see your excited post will nod sagely. You are worthy. You have taken the veil seriously. Thus, the union of cheese and wine is written into matching lore after all. Who would deny it?</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is more than a match, for goodness sake; it is the bloody sacrament!</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wedding bells chime, but is this truly a match made in heaven? The Comté cheese is known for its complex, rich, and nutty flavour profile. It can be described as exhibiting notes of brown butter, roasted nuts, and a sweet finish. The flavour also evolves with aging, becoming more intense and complex with longer maturation. There are certain flavours that go well with the wine (Comté often is served with walnuts) and Vin Jaune is certainly liquid nuts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe it is meant to work, so it does. If you use your imagination anything is possible. Feeling that something should be is as more important than it working on a molecular level.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How do you find the bread?”</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A little dry, but I have my old sauce here,” returned John Baptist, holding up his knife.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How sauce?”</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can cut my bread so—like a melon. Or so—like an omelette. Or so—like a fried fish. Or so—like Lyons sausage,” said John Baptist, demonstrating the various cuts on the bread he held, and soberly chewing what he had in his mouth.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;Little Dorrit, Charles Dickens</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works both in the imagination and reality.</span></p>
<h2><b>And finally…</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most delightful meals are balanced in every respect and also match the need and the particular mood of the one who is eating and drinking.  A one-disher (a stew, for example) is probably best enjoyed with a single wine. A more complex affair, with a succession of different dishes with different textures and flavours, is better matched to different wines that are broadly complementary. It helps to avoid sensory overload whilst dining; one can then appreciate both the food and the wine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign for value-for-money real wine starts here. We love wines that are packed with personality at democratic price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.casabalaguer.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finca Casa Balaguer</a> is a small family-owned winery based in Alicante run by Andres Carull and Marta Ribera. Their wines are made in the most natural way possible with the proud focus on organic agriculture. Local grape varieties such as Monastrell, Merseguera, Moscatel and Malvasia are used to make the various wines as well as other lesser-seen natives, and only natural yeasts are used in their wines with zero corrective additions. In their own words, “we believe our grapes should express themselves naturally, so it is our job as winemakers to provide them with the best possible environment in which to grow. The less intervention from us in the winery the better, so our wines can truly reflect the character of our wonderful land.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casa Balaguer Blanco and Tinto are the true reflection of everything they believe in. Combining their philosophy, beliefs, soils and grape varieties, these two wines are the purest representation of how they interpret the mountain (and coastal) viticulture in the Mediterranean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overall climate is typically hot, humid and Mediterranean near the coast, becoming drier and more continental further inland where the vineyards are at higher elevations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casa Balaguer is the third generation of vine growers, continuing the hard work started by their grandparents over 65 years ago. As the first generation to make bottled wine, their determination is to produce high quality wines with as little human intervention in the winery as possible, in short natural wines. In order to achieve this, the work that takes place in the vines is fundamental to the endeavour. Everything is done therefore to favour the best quality grapes produced under the strict principles of organic and biodynamic agriculture. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Puerto-desde-embalse.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11410" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Puerto-desde-embalse.jpg" alt="" width="895" height="503" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Puerto-desde-embalse.jpg 1833w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Puerto-desde-embalse-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Puerto-desde-embalse-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Puerto-desde-embalse-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Puerto-desde-embalse-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Puerto-desde-embalse-800x450.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the grapes for the Casa Balaguer Blanco come from the “Parque Natural de La Mata Torrevieja”, a national park comprising salt water lagoons by the coast at Torrevieja, south of the city of Alicante. Bush vines (some old) nestle amongst the sand dunes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wine comprises 30% Merseguera, 30% Malvasía, 20% Moscatel de Alejandría with 10% Tortosí &amp; 10% Verdil. Grapes are harvested manually with the five varieties fermented separately with varying degrees of skin contact. The juice is blended and aged for three months in small-batch concrete tanks, before a light filtration and a bottling according to the biodynamic calendar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resultant wine is medium straw yellow in colour. Stone fruit and citrus on the nose with hints of white jasmine leads to an invigorating palate which develops Mediterranean characteristics of fennel and eucalyptus and notes of dried spice from the variable. skin-contact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The red wine hails from vineyards planted on alluvial stony soils from the river Vinalopo up in the Alicante mountains (around 650-700m above sea level) and is made up of 40% Monastrell, 30% Garnacha Peluda, 15% Arcos, 10% Valencí, 5% Tortosí, many of which are old vines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again the different varieties are fermented individually with varying degrees of whole bunch and maceration. The wines are blended and matured in various vessels, the Monastrell ageing 8 months in used oak (500L), Garnacha Peluda &#8211; 12 months in concrete vats, Arcos &#8211; 8 months in amphora, Valencí &#8211; 8 months in amphora and demi-johns &amp; Tortosí &#8211; stainless steel only.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bright cherry in colour, this medium-bodied red has vibrant red fruits on the nose with strawberry and raspberry leading the way and infused with a subtle lavender and thyme character. A solid mouthful of red wine and one that punches far above its weight.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All ashes to the taste.</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/eyes-304338_1280.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11398" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/eyes-304338_1280.png" alt="" width="541" height="372" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/eyes-304338_1280.png 1280w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/eyes-304338_1280-300x206.png 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/eyes-304338_1280-1024x704.png 1024w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/eyes-304338_1280-768x528.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a wine buyer, you very occasionally cop a bouquet for a newly acquired wine that is showing fine and dandy, but many more brickbats will be launched in your direction when a wine tasted with customers is found to be unpleasant &#8211; and even faulty. First world problems, eh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I write my tongue has been doubly scalped, first by a red whose fruit has suddenly become harsh and metallic, and then by a seductively-smelling white wine, initially texturally alluring in the mouth, but once spat out, commenced transmitting all-too-vivid reminders of dropped cinema popcorn – or, as we in the trade call it, mousiness. The combo of the two sensations was pure caustic overload – I am trying to mitigate it with water, juice, bread, ointment, prayers – anything &#8211; but I feel that a thousand taste buds have perished during my reckless quality-control exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you taste a lot of wine in such circumstances you are bound to recoil at unpleasantness or disagreeability in different ways, and according to the way you feel about the wine and the way it performs at a given moment.  Sometimes, I recoil quickly, because it saves time. Said wine may be too tannic or too acidic or too alcoholic or too oaky for my particular palate. Although I prefer not to drink wines marked by a certain style, I cannot be overly critical, for others may enjoy the very qualities of the wine of the wine that I am usually deterred by.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am trying to mitigate it with water, juice, bread, ointment, prayers-anything-but I feel that a thousand taste buds have perished during my reckless quality-control exercise.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I am experiencing now is fundamentally more disconcerting. Wine faults so blatantly unpleasant that my whole mouth is offended by the fact that I deemed it necessary in the first place to allow these liquids passage over my tongue. The acrid burn of excessive sulphur has the same effect; I can detect its burnt-match presence long after the wine has vacated my mouth. These undeniable faults are absolute rather than relative. And perhaps I am extra annoyed about the wines tasted today, as in both cases behind the faults lurks the whisper of a promise of a lovely wine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing about mousiness is that it gives no aromatic indication that it will manifest. It is the “tail” of the unexpected. That moment of hope with the wine swirling happily around the mouth, the beginnings of a relieved smile, the satisfied spit, all extinguished by the slow envelopment by flavours of mouse. As it mixes with the saliva, the concentration increases, until the tongue is literally shrivelling under the influence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other wine faults make us doubt what we are tasting. That bitter metallic note on the red today puzzles me. Because I am uncertain what the name (and nature) of the fault is, I need to retaste to confirm the unpleasantness of the wine. The naming of a fault would feel like a scientific underpinning for what I taste and enable me to articulate an organised response. Instead I have an undifferentiated feeling of dissatisfaction, and I am more annoyed by myself than the wine.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quality control assessment is generally a solitary task.  It feels like penance. Ashes without sackcloth, and the ashes being in my mouth. As a buyer, when a wine is demonstrably faulty, you must accept your portion of the blame, as it entered the stock of your company under your auspices, which seems to betoken a lack of vigilance, whether or not that is fair and true. And yes, all sorts of things can happen to a wine from bottle shock to mousiness (and other faults) developing in the bottle. Wine is not predictable and is often mutable, but we have to take the commercial decision whether it is fit to be sold, and whether the fault is temporary or permanent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quality control task could surely be performed by AI, so that I – in all my craven humanity – ha &#8211; should not have to experience wine at its most perverse. I don’t normally approach wine as the sum total of its chemical and microbiological faults, rather as a beverage that I wish to consume and enjoy the experience. In spite of retuning my tasting persona to manifest a purely analytical mindset, I still harbour expectations, in this case, the possibility that this example will be perfectly worthy of consumption. The moment those hopes are overturned, I am flooded by feelings of disappointment. Disappointment on behalf of the grower, the sales reps, the customers, and myself as a buyer – not to mention the physical reflexive puckering!. This amplifies the feel-bad factor of the experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its core, disappointment is a cognitive event where an individual perceives a gap between expectations and reality. Expectation, in this context, is a hopeful belief about what will soon happen (in this case, tasting a wine, and for it to pass the examination). When these expectations are not met, cognitive dissonance occurs, triggering a range of emotions, including disappointment.  From a neurological angle, disappointment activates the brain&#8217;s reward system, specifically the dopamine pathways. When expectations are unmet, the dopamine levels drop, leading to feelings of letdown.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">When expectations are not met, cognitive dissonance occurs, triggering a range of emotions</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience should teach me to lower my expectations, but I also believe that if you are in a positive frame of mind when approaching a wine, you get more out of it. Deconstructive tasters are probably less perturbed when a wine is faulty; they may feel that it is their professional role to root out the bad apples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disappointment is more than a bad taste in the mouth. The quality control taste is a physical snapshot of the drinkability (or otherwise) of the wine. The disappointment is further extended by having to communicate with various people about the nature of the fault and to assess what needs to be done. No-one enjoys breaking bad news. There are financial and reputational implications when a wine is deemed faulty (especially if all the wines in that batch or bottling suffer from the same flaw). The producer needs to share the disappointment, otherwise there is a sense of transactional grievance, and good communication is essential, so that the problem is identified, accepted, an equitable solution found, and everyone can move on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is arbitrariness time. When you see a wine glorified on social media you are meant to feel a bat squeak of envy. Look what they are drinking and look who they are drinking with. And where. What you don’t ask is whether the wines consumed were any good? All very well to post a photo of a super-cuveé Provençale rosé as you sit outside picnicking, but was the wine simply a bystander in the enchantment of sun, fun and friends, and actually pretty damn ordinary?</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The specially deserving bottles get their day in the sun when I take them to the balcony. It is my attempt to immortalise the moment with the light from the setting sun beaming through the bottle and illuminating the adjacent liquid-filled glass.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the times I open a bottle at home, I am just curious to know what it tastes like, so if anyone asks me I can truthfully recommend it (or not). Although I will always drink with food, it is not the food I am thinking about. I barely consider matching, and if it happens, then it is serendipitous rather than by design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The specially deserving bottles get their day in the sun when I take them to the balcony. It is my attempt to immortalise the moment with the light from the setting sun beaming through the bottle and illuminating the adjacent liquid-filled glass. In retrospect, this setting up the photo&#8211;and the resultant photo itself&#8211;acts as an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">aide-memoire</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when I wish to recall how I felt about the wine in question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretly, I also belong to the not-so-secret listifarian tendency. Although we may pretend to be above the idea of ranking one wine above another, and doing “best of” lists, we cannot avoid sporting our preferences.  And here I am! Certain wines will always speak to us more clearly than others and it is natural to want to validate the experience in some way. What we do is to create a diary of our best wine experiences and rank them from top to bottom – or the other way round.</span></p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top 10!</span></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following hit the right nerve at the time (in no particular order):</span></p>
<h2><b>2017 Chignin Bergeron Grand Orgue, Louis Magnin</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grapes for this selection come from two parcels of the oldest vines of the estate. Stylistically, the “Grande Orgue” is ripe and rich without giving up the discipline that makes these wines of the Savoie so compelling. The aromas speak of wild flowers and honeysuckle and warm apricot while the palate is marked by notes of anise preceding a penetrating finish of bristling minerality. The Magnin Arbin Mondeuse also deserves a mention for its penetrating dark fruit character.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I loved this: A wine that hit a sweet spot in my palate. I love freshness in wines that describe a clean line across the tongue but increasingly am coming back to more textural (leesy) whites that you can roll over the “width” of the palate and dive into their golden-fleshed orchard fruit and rich spice.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lapalu-VDF-Feu-Follet-Gringet-2021.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11387" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lapalu-VDF-Feu-Follet-Gringet-2021.jpg" alt="" width="293" height="731" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lapalu-VDF-Feu-Follet-Gringet-2021.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lapalu-VDF-Feu-Follet-Gringet-2021-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lapalu-VDF-Feu-Follet-Gringet-2021-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>2021 Jean-Claude Lapalu Feu Follet, Haute-Savoie (at Elliott’s for lunch)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, we gathered as many samples of wines made from the Gringet grape. Many versions were from the 2021 vintage, the year after Dominique Belluard, doyen of the variety, passed away. Jean-Francois Ganevat’s Le Feu and Les Vins de Belema Imago were the closest in style, but Lapalu’s Feu Follet was beautifully fluid and almost evanescent in the best sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I loved this: The wine felt like it was hewn out of limestone scree, the calling card of this part of the Haute-Savoie. Also, blessed to taste this snapshot of history.</span></p>
<h2><b>2021 Domaine des Miroirs Ja Do, Jura (at <a href="https://www.brawn.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brawn</a> for dinner)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This rare blend of Ploussard &amp; Trousseau was unlike any red wine I have tried. Turbid and savoury with almost Syrah-like smokiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I loved this: It’s unusual to taste a wine that surprises one and flips one’s preconceptions. I should know that the Miroirs wines conform to no rules other than their own.</span></p>
<h2><b>2020 Arbois Pupillin Rouge Overnoy, Jura (at <a href="https://mountainbeakstreet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mountain</a> for lunch)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Captivating red, the kind that arrests your conversation around the table whilst you sup its aromatic charms. Ploussard at its purest, and on the day, most eloquent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I loved this: Less can be more, a wine of essence and linear edge. As we drank the wine, we just felt happy.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Igavi-Tsolikouri-Lechkhumi-White.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11388" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Igavi-Tsolikouri-Lechkhumi-White.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="681" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Igavi-Tsolikouri-Lechkhumi-White.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Igavi-Tsolikouri-Lechkhumi-White-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Igavi-Tsolikouri-Lechkhumi-White-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>2023 Tsolikouri Lechkhumi Igavi, Georgia</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sparkling purity where altitude and limestone terroir align to give the wine its crunchy zing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I loved this: Like shoving minerals in one’s mouth. Sometimes you feel like sucking on liquidised shells and rocks.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bruno-Duchene-IGP-La-Luna-Blanc.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11389" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bruno-Duchene-IGP-La-Luna-Blanc.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="729" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bruno-Duchene-IGP-La-Luna-Blanc.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bruno-Duchene-IGP-La-Luna-Blanc-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bruno-Duchene-IGP-La-Luna-Blanc-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>2024 La Luna Blanc Bruno Duchene, Cote Vermeille</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno Duchene’s IGP Côte Vermeille La Luna Blanc. Côte Merveille, more like! To exploit my own favourite wine cliché, this blend of Xarel.lo, Grenache Gris &amp; Grenache Blanc tastes like “the Muscadet of the south”, by which I mean a wine that seems to have soaked up the salt air of the sea whilst simultaneously preserving the medicinal/herbal notes of the scrubland. My impression of the wine, of course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I loved this: Wine has this undeniable capacity to transport you to places that you have never physically been but exist in your fond imagination. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rabasco-Cancelli-Rosato-2024.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11390" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rabasco-Cancelli-Rosato-2024.jpg" alt="" width="293" height="731" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rabasco-Cancelli-Rosato-2024.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rabasco-Cancelli-Rosato-2024-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rabasco-Cancelli-Rosato-2024-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>2024 Cancelli Rosato, Iole Rabasco, Abruzzo</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s Montepulciano. It is almost red in colour and packed with fruit. It is natural and gorgeous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I loved this: It is a natural rosé, no compromises. Feelgood colour. Delicious spiced red cherry and plum flavours. A balcony wine earning its sunset background.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Frick-Chasselas-Sans-Soufre-NV-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11392" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Frick-Chasselas-Sans-Soufre-NV-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="721" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Frick-Chasselas-Sans-Soufre-NV-scaled.jpg 1026w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Frick-Chasselas-Sans-Soufre-NV-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Frick-Chasselas-Sans-Soufre-NV-410x1024.jpg 410w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Frick-Chasselas-Sans-Soufre-NV-768x1916.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Frick-Chasselas-Sans-Soufre-NV-616x1536.jpg 616w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Frick-Chasselas-Sans-Soufre-NV-821x2048.jpg 821w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>2023 Domaine Pierre Frick Chasselas sans soufre, Alsace</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frick’s wines are a beautiful mystery. The layers of this wine show the best of natural wine. Words cannot do justice to this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I loved this: Occasionally, I am worried about faults, so I look for them and don’t see the wine in front of me. As soon as this coated my mouth, I experienced the wine as something utterly wholesome and completely alive.</span></p>
<h2><b>2023 Alice &amp; Olivier De Moor Bourgogne Aligoté</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ever so ‘umble Aligoté performs eloquently in the skilled hands of the De Moors. The vineyards are set up for maximum quality, the pruning is excellent, the farming is organic, the yields are low, and the winemaking is precise.  Fluidity mingles with texture – coolness with warmth, subtlety with length. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I loved this: I am a sucker for the underdog grape. Aligoté is now gaining a reputation, and this particular wine has never disappointed.</span></p>
<h2><b>2023 Hermitage Blanc, Dard &amp; Ribo, N Rhone (at <a href="https://noblerot.co.uk/restaurant/soho" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noble Rot Soho</a>)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wine of the first six months. Sharing this bottle with nine fellow wine experts and drinkers, I only had a sliverette in my glass, but oh, how I savoured every molecule as a result. The fruit and spice ruffle over the tongue like a gentle tide. I was enveloped for an instant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I loved this: The moment that we collectively put the wine in our mouths and sighed with intense satisfaction. Not because it was obviously gratifying, but it was beautifully reserved, an essay in quiet harmony.</span></p>

<h2><b>2021 A Demua, Cascina degli Ulivi, Piemonte</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huge wine with gorgeous bronze colour, a field blend from a centenarian vineyard planted to local Piedmontese grapes: Bosco, Verdea, Timorasso, Chasselas…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I loved this: Are you ever predisposed to admire a wine before you have even tasted it? We have not had this Bellotti wine in stock for years, so I was eager to get to grips, at the same time fearful of disappointment. As with the Chasselas from Jean-Pierre Frick (see above), this wine is dense with mouthfeel. The lengthy skin-maceration gives a further dimension. I didn’t even notice the 14% abv.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.damianociolli.it/en/wines/#top" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Damiano Ciolli</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ciolli family has owned five (now seven) hectares of vineyards for four generations in Central Italy, south-east of Rome. Before Damiano, his grandfather and his father used to sell their wines in bulk to the nearby capital. When he took charge of the winery in 2001, Damiano immediately focused on quality, persuaded, as he was, that the Cesanese variety could yield very fine wines. In his search to maximise the potential of the grape and the vineyard, he was supported by his family and his partner, Letizia Rocchi, who later obtained a PHD in vine physiology and oenology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main body of the 7-ha vineyards is located below Olevano Romano, a village at the foot of Monte Celeste, and these are sheltered by hills on three sides, facing west towards the Tyrrhenian sea and receiving a drying breeze that blows inland each day, reducing humidity and consequent disease pressure. It is here that Cesanese d’Affile, one of the Roman “alveole” grapes, thrives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vines are planted on deep red volcanic soil with a south-eastern exposure, 450 metres above sea level in a natural amphitheatre. Silene is obtained from 100% Cesanese d’Affile grapes blended from different vineyard blocks, which are on average 30 years old. Silene is actually named after a wildflower that grows in Damiano Ciolli’s vineyards, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silene vulgaris, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">recognised by its characteristic balloon shape.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he took charge of the winery in 2001, Damiano immediately focused on quality, persuaded, as he was, that the Cesanese variety could yield very fine wines.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damiano and Letizia focus on maintaining the fertility of the soil, which is why they use green manures, as well as biodynamic and organic products in their vineyards. Yields are 1.5-2kg per vine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grapes are hand harvested with each of the four blocks fermented separately (ambient, with native yeasts) in concrete vats and the maceration length is about 10 days. After racking, the Silene is aged in concrete vats for a year on its fine lees, after which the separate ferments are blended and bottled and matured for a further three months in bottle. Other than racking, the wine is unfiltered, and no finings are used. Sulphites are kept to a minimum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pure Cesanese is ruby red with garnet hues, with a forward nose revealing pleasant fruity aromas of cranberries and pomegranate, dried roses and herbs. The palate is crisp and lean with notes of wild herbs and aromatic spices (think juniper), nicely balanced with good tannins that blend perfectly with a mineral hint. It is versatile with food such as leg of lamb or porchetta, and in summer chilled down as an accompaniment to pizzas or grilled sausages and barbecued mediterranean veg.</span></p>

<p class="p2" style="text-align: center;"><i>“From that moment on, everything becomes agitated.

<p class="p2"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/coffee-2714970_1280.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11373" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/coffee-2714970_1280.jpg" alt="" width="723" height="482" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/coffee-2714970_1280.jpg 896w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/coffee-2714970_1280-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/coffee-2714970_1280-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /></a></p>
<p>In my experience (as well as anecdotal evidence from other people) the first cup of coffee (in my case, an espresso) is always the best of the day. Whether one’s first daily encounter with wine is also the most gratifying depends on various factors and revolves around the question: is it the hit of refreshment and alcohol that we seek or are we drinking with other purposes in mind?</p>
<p class="p3">The act of drinking always starts <i>before</i> the liquid passes over the lips. Dopamine, the pleasure hormone, is released the very moment one begins to anticipate the day’s first cup of coffee. In other words, the feelgood factor starts in advance, fr0m the point of knowing that you are soon going to be drinking coffee and satisfying a craving.</p>
<p class="p3">Moreover, associating coffee &#8211; or wine- with pleasure may mean that the actions that bring you closer to experiencing that pleasure create their own mini-Pavlovian response &#8211; such as walking to your favourite café or, with wine, pulling a bottle from the rack, locating the corkscrew, or opening and surveying the wine list in a bar. These ritual moments prior to gratification are almost as satisfying as the moment of gratification itself.</p>
<p class="p3">Time is part of the ritual. I crave my first cup of coffee between 8.00 am and 8.15 am precisely. I need that cup of coffee to start my day, both symbolically (firing the starter gun, so to speak) and physiologically (for the caffeine rush). I don’t consume wine in the morning, and although I may drink it a glass or two if I go out for lunch, as a meaningful beverage I associate it more with sitting down to dinner and sharing a bottle with others, a ritual part of social relaxation.</p>
<p class="p3">Smelling the coffee can certainly wake you up. We know that aromas are powerful triggers, penetrating deep into our memories and stimulating emotions. When you particularly enjoy the smell of something (and coffee has a strong smell) bundles of pleasant associations may be brought to the fore. Wine, with its aromatic vapours, can do the same.</p>
<p class="p3">Coffee, of course, is a stimulant.<b> </b>One’s body absorbs caffeine quickly, so it takes minutes to reach your brain. Once there, it works by binding to the same receptors in the brain as adenosine, but without activating them. This blockage prevents adenosine from slowing down nerve activity, leading to increased alertness and wakefulness.  Alcohol&#8217;s ability to induce striatal dopamine release is the mechanism underlying its<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>stimulatory effects, but, in the end, it also has a sedative and depressant effect.</p>
<p class="p3">If the aroma of coffee alone intimates gratification, our initial sip of coffee elicits an intense response, as our taste buds are excited by the bold, complex flavours. The sensation of the heat of the liquid against the lips and tongue also enhances the experience, warming not just the mouth but speaking to a deeper need inside of us. These combined elements create a ritualistic experience that signifies, for example, the start of a new day or takes us into a moment of pause and reflection. It is not only the kick, but the comfort.</p>
<p class="p3">This intensity cannot be sustained for more than an instant. With each subsequent sip, one’s taste receptors become less sensitive to the familiar taste, leading to a decrease in the perceived level of pleasure. The intricate balance of compounds that create the unique flavour profile of the coffee is disrupted, leading to a less intense and less satisfying taste experience, a phenomenon showcasing how our sensory system adapts to stimuli and shaping our overall sensory experience of coffee. This concept of adaptation shows why the first sip of coffee can often be the most satisfying, as our senses respond most intensely to novel stimuli.</p>
<p class="p3">Not that I sip my espresso (it can’t be tasted in a sip!). Instead, I bolt it and wait for the rush. There is no analysis involved. Sipping is for cognac or so-called meditation wines. Small sips are different to large sips, the ratio of saliva to liquid varying. A small sip of wine becomes diluted in the mouth very quickly, scarcely giving us sufficient time to process olfactory information other than the most primary of aromas. A big mouthful can, however, overwhelm the taste buds although it allows us to explore textural elements of the wine. When we come to secondary sips we already have residuary saliva-wine in our mouth, not to mention changing temperatures and the ph values. This is part of the adaptive process of wine tasting.</p>
<p class="p3">I have finished my espresso and briefly feel as if I am in an altered mental state<b>. </b>My high contrasts to the time when I wake in the morning at which point my brain is full of adenosine, and I am still groggy from sleep. This gulf between where you were and where you are now is what makes that first cup especially potent.</p>
<p class="p3">Not that expectation is always matched by reality. A badly-made coffee is worse than no coffee at all, because lofty expectations are dashed, and disappointment feels sharper than denial.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/holding-drink.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-10873" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/holding-drink.jpg" alt="" width="637" height="761" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/holding-drink.jpg 904w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/holding-drink-251x300.jpg 251w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/holding-drink-857x1024.jpg 857w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/holding-drink-768x918.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /></a></p>
<p class="p3">Our expectations and needs also affect the way we perceive the taste of a particular wine. The gastric desire (thirst) for a glass of wine, with its flavours supported by alcohol are similar to the desire for the quick caffeine fix.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The drinking context is different, however. We are not drinking a quick shot of wine but enjoying a glass or two. Or three. An espresso is like a haiku, pithy and precise. A bottle of wine is more like an evolving story. Over the course of its consumption we have the opportunity and the time to consider the wine and understand the flavours.</p>
<p class="p3">On the other hand, taste is affected by alcohol which ultimately has a desensitising effect, interfering with the body&#8217;s ability to absorb certain nutrients, such as vitamin B complex, vitamin A, and zinc, which can, in turn, change the structure and function of one&#8217;s saliva and taste buds and result in less sensitivity to texture and certain tastes.</p>
<p class="p3">How about when we order the second bottle of wine in a restaurant, for example, and it doesn’t measure up to our enjoyment of the first? Is it that we are bored by the repetitive flavours or are too desensitised by the alcohol in our system to enjoy it to the same degree? Yet, equally, the second bottle might taste better than the first &#8211; if its flavours align more closely to our expectations. The wine is not an immutable constant. A living liquid can improve in the glass or the decanter as it reaches its ideal temperature for our best appreciation. We ourselves are in constant neurological ferment, our sensitivities continuously shifting.</p>
<p class="p3">The tension between expectation and reaction is arguably most marked when we encounter a wine that made a powerful impression when we first encountered it. That impression, often prompted by the name of the wine or its label, is in the forefront of one’s memory, easily retrieved and consequently more tangible. The second bottle of the same wine is never the same for doubtless a wealth of objective and subjective reasons, but that doesn’t stop us seeking the same measure of gratification as when we first experienced it and being disappointed if it doesn’t measure up.</p>
<p class="p3">Wine drinking is not the same as wine appreciation. A glass of wine can simply be a drink that hits the spot (like an espresso) or enjoyed critically and aesthetically. Often I yearn simply for a white chilled to the best temperature and anticipate that primal jolt of refreshing mineral-rich liquid as it courses across the tongue. Alternatively, I might desire something completely different such as a powerful expansive red to envelop my taste buds and very being in its warm embrace. With food on the table and company present, my needs tack in different directions. In the company of wine buffs, analysis and judgement will probably take precedence over thirst-smashing.</p>
<p class="p3">My most memorable wine experiences are when I am pleasurably shocked. In neuropsychological terms, my dopamine levels rise as when the espresso shot hits the mark. And that yields a focused rush, triggers receptors, and commences the process of gratification.</p>
<p class="p3">Although the first hit of wine may quench a thirst (the liquid hit or the desire for alcohol), a different type of appreciation emerges after the second or third glass. Coffee connoisseurs will no doubt enjoy the subtleties of the coffee’s aromas and flavours beyond the initial smack of caffeine; our relationship with the wine will arguably change even more significantly. The wine itself will develop in the glass as the ambient temperature brings different aromatics to the fore. We ourselves may “warm up”, acquiring clearer focus or simply relaxing and being more responsive as a result. This is our development. When we taste, we cognitively initiate a process of pattern-recognition and assessment which transforms into aesthetic appreciation (and then pleasure). Caffeine gives me a wonderful short-term high, whereas many (good) wines are slow-burners and I enjoy them most when I assay the second and third glass.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regenerative farming is attractive as a philosophy in that it puts nature and the environment first. Post-war farming practices have been industrial (exploitation of the land leading to over-production) or commercial (requiring homogenous outcomes) – using nature as a means to an end, not taking into consideration the damage done to the soil, to the environment, to our health and our mental well-being. Nor is what is produced wholesome. Food (and drink) generally lacks dietary sustenance because the necessary probiotic material that provides it with those qualities has been ruptured by chemical additions (during every stage of the farming and manufacturing process).</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies on horticultural therapy show that immersing oneself in a natural environment is beneficial to mental health. </span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regenerative farming helps to join the dots–from the ground up. Revitalising the biome encouraging organic growth or microbiological organisms in the soil, allowing plant, insect, bird and animal life to flourish, and by virtue of example teaching us why these things should matter to us a society, involving the community, giving adults and children the opportunity to appreciate nature and to be a part of it. Studies on horticultural therapy show that immersing oneself in a natural environment is beneficial to mental health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On another level, regenerative farming is connected with the Golden Rule, where ethical trading partnerships based on mutual respect, rather than obviously commercial transactional ones, are forged. The word “holistic” is perhaps over-used, but a regenerative philosophy involves approaching farming in the round, creating a sustainable long-term programme that benefits all and creating lasting connections and leaves a legacy to the next generation. In this sense, it is like mycelium, the vegetative part of a fungus with its root network of thread-like structures called hyphae that extends into soil or other substrates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of the nuts and bolts of regen farming, plenty of research goes into discovering what works and what doesn’t. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, even if there are common guiding principles. Responding to challenges creatively is part of the ongoing learning process (natural solutions to natural problems) rather than always reverting to the chemical silver bullet. Perhaps the most important less to learn is that every decision we make has consequences. Giving nature a helping hand might require active involvement or allowing things to take their course. Farming practice has shaped the land over the centuries and in recent decades has been about pushing against nature, making the land work on our behalf rather than viewing farming as a kind of stewardship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a wine company, we want to work with wines that reflect the places that they come from and the passion of the people who make them. Organic and sustainable farming practices are fundamental to this. Farming must be a nurturing process, not a single-sided transaction where resources are extracted, and nothing is ever returned. The earth’s ecosystem is fragile and easily impacted. Land and water are both precious and finite resources. Regenerative farming helps to set in place essential (local) programmes for auditing inputs and monitoring outcomes and the offers solutions for long-term resilience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would rather lead people to these conclusions, rather than preach at them. To see the difference when land is sustainably farmed and ultimately to taste the difference. The evidence lies primarily in the life of the vineyard and the delicious and nourishing flavours of the wines themselves.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Frappato (and now Grillo) sings</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From season to season the earth speaks to us, listens to us, responds to us. Ours is a silent and authentic dialogue. This is why there cannot be &#8220;a formula&#8221;, but convictions that arise from experience.” </span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Arianna-Occhipinti-5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11360" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Arianna-Occhipinti-5.jpg" alt="" width="526" height="789" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Arianna-Occhipinti-5.jpg 1150w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Arianna-Occhipinti-5-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Arianna-Occhipinti-5-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Arianna-Occhipinti-5-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Arianna-Occhipinti-5-1024x1536.jpg 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winemaking is so much more than what occurs in the winery. Above all else, <a href="https://www.agricolaocchipinti.it/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arianna Occhipinti</a> is determined to develop a respectful relationship with the land: a direct and constant contact that transforms itself into profound knowledge. This entails looking for &#8211; and promoting &#8211; balance, respecting nature in every action: from planning the birth of a vineyard to its cultivation throughout the cycle, from the pruning which must be clean, precise and sympathetic, up to the processing and harvesting of the fruit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This balance may be simply summarised: a good wine always comes from healthy grapes. They try to achieve this by encouraging biodiversity, the life in and around the vines. Arianna prefers to work the land by hand to be as close as possible to the vines themselves, and only use grapes from healthy soils, farmed without pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, chemical or synthetic fertilisers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her philosophy extends to consider the spontaneous materials that grow in the vineyards themselves and help oxygenate and nourish the soil, whilst augmenting these with mixtures of treatments other than green manure &#8211; such as leguminous plants, grasses and cruciferous plants which are sown in the spring, and that contribute to the development of vital organic matter and soil organisms. They further seek to preserve the surrounding natural flora and view it as a great resource. Hedges and bushes, the Mediterranean maquis, the wooded areas, and the olive trees of Tonda Iblae and Nocellara del Belice all flourish, to which they have added fruit trees, a vegetable garden and Tumminia wheat. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Above all else, <a href="https://www.agricolaocchipinti.it/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arianna Occhipinti</a> is determined to develop a respectful relationship with the land: a direct and constant contact that transforms itself into profound knowledge.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They use and propagate old clones of the native grapes, making mass selection and grafting in the field. By doing this, the vineyard becomes more robust and carries within itself the texture of a past and the strength for its future. Harvesting is also done by hand. The grapes are meticulously selected first in the vineyard and then again in the cellar, only in this way do they believe they can work with the best, healthiest and most mature bunches. Healthy grapes tend to ensure healthy fermentations which take place spontaneously with their own indigenous yeasts. They accompany the wine in its evolution in by letting it breathe in non-intrusive containers that respect its vitality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arianna remarks: “”Our work in the vineyard is an inexhaustible source of observation.” She focuses on the classic varieties of Vittoria, namely Frappato and Nero d’Avola, and most recently on Grillo, on the subtle difference in the soils, of the potential of different areas and their influence on the wines. The vines work on an interplay of sand and limestone, which manifests in the wines as fruitiness and silkiness on the one hand, acidity and energy on the other (when the farming is right), and Arianna seeks to capture these qualities in a sympathetic vinification process. Her research led her to go further coming to the idea of “una vigna, un vigno” The Contrada wines project in Vittoria was born in 2016, followed by the desire to produce a wine in the Monti Iblei, and, in particular, in the area of Chiaramonte Gulfi, in the Contrada Santa Margherita.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The climate here is influenced by winds off the African continent (these often bring deposits of sand that covers the landscape). A dry cooling mistral-type wind swirls down from the north originally and then comes int from the south-western side of the island. This part of Sicily is experiencing drought with rainfall almost a third of normal, creating severe vine stress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three main types of soil: limestone of a predominantly clay-sandy nature of Pliocene origin, rich in flints and shells on the first 25-30cm lying over deep sea carbonate sediments; silty sand, medium-textured and rich in iron and calcareous sediments, that allow the roots to deeply penetrate the soil, and tuphous sand, alternating calcareous stones and red sand, rich in iron, resting on carbonate sediments, porous, rich in fossils and marine debris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The estate comprises eight vineyard zones of varying sizes, four of which provide the selection of grapes for each of the Contrada wines. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bombolieri</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, planted in 1999 at 212 m above sea level, is the most southerly of these nestled against the SP68 road adjacent to the winery, and Frappato di Vittoria, Nero d’Avola, Zibibbo and Albanello grow here on 25 cm surface layer of white sand interspersed with compact limestone rock. The 100% Contrada Frappato wine called BB comes from here. One is not allowed to refer to the Contrada name on the label, which therefore has the initials BB – crossed out!<a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Arianna-Occhipinti-Contrada-BB-2022.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11362" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Arianna-Occhipinti-Contrada-BB-2022.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="588" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Arianna-Occhipinti-Contrada-BB-2022.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Arianna-Occhipinti-Contrada-BB-2022-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Arianna-Occhipinti-Contrada-BB-2022-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fossa di Lupo, at 214 metres above sea level, is located just north-east of this vineyard on the same winding road. This plot (guyot and bush vine trained) is planted to Frappato and Nero d’Avola only. Here we find 40cm of brown sand over a bedrock of compact limestone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pettineo (217 m above sea level and north/south exposition) is the oldest vineyard (68-years-old bush vines and espalier trained), planted solely to Frappato. It lies on 60 cm of red sand with a layer of “tuff” (porous rock) in the subsoil. This vineyard gives its names to the PT cuvee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grapes for all the reds are harvested towards the end of September normally, are 80% destemmed with the berries kept whole, and then fed into large concrete fermenters. All the wines macerate gently on their skins for 20-days before maturation for a further 20-22 months in cement ovals and a short period in bottle. A small amount of sulphites may be added during vinification, but never at bottling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frappato di Vittoria is often viewed as a lighter red grape variety used to ameliorate the darker, heavier Nero d’Avola in the Cerasuolo di Vittoria DOCG wines. In fact, Frappato is more tannic than Nero d’Avola and, farmed sympathetically on the best limestone soils in the region, presents fresh, perfumed wines with red fruit flavours, a line of acidity running through them and fine crunchy tannins. The grape variety is a beautiful vehicle for terroir expression, which is why Arianna has chosen it specially for her Contrada range of reds.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ariannas_DSC9736-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11363" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ariannas_DSC9736-2.jpg" alt="" width="774" height="517" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ariannas_DSC9736-2.jpg 1840w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ariannas_DSC9736-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ariannas_DSC9736-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ariannas_DSC9736-2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ariannas_DSC9736-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BB, from light-coloured, almost white chalky-sand shallow soils, is the most upfront and floral of the three Frappatos. It is fresh and energetic with beguiling aromas of cherries, wild strawberries, and blood orange and the classic Frappato perfume of incense. The acidity is most pronounced in this wine, and the purity of the limestone comes through clearly. FL is almost Nebbiolo-like, quite austere with notes of dried fruit, rose, cedar and wild herbs with a nice punch of acidity on the finish. An earthy wine with a touch of salinity. Finally, PT, from the oldest vines on the estate, has rich fruitiness and gorgeous smooth tannins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the most recent addition to the Contrada family comes from Santa Margherita on the foot slopes of the Iblean Mountains. Here Arianna planted Grillo (from cuttings taken from a grower in the Marsala region of the island) in 2016. The vineyard is trained in bush vines and Guyot, is at 490 m above sea level, and orientated northeast/southwest; northwest/southeast; and east/west.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grapes are harvested in the first week and a half of September, and, after a 48-hour maceration, are fermented with native yeasts in concrete tanks and 25-hl Stockinger oval foudres, before ageing for a further 10 months in the same vessels and four months in bottle. The wine style has changed over the years from amber and exotic to more elegant and restrained with citrus tones and precise minerality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of Arianna’s journey is the realisation that one needs to work with nature to preserve the balance in the wines. Vine growing and winemaking is about listening to the vintage and respecting the territory and therefore must always be responsive. Even though the wines are different for the reasons mentioned, there is a common thread running through them and they possess the qualities of freshness, minerality and strength. In a vintage such as 21 we taste the warmth of the rocks and maquis in the wines, those signifiers of Mediterranean island terroir, whereas in the challenging 2022 , the wines are charming, lighter and more floral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frappato, the historical variety of Vittoria, which Arianna is devoted to, may present itself variously as delicate, austere, and bloody. Here, in the Contrada wines, Frappato is an instrument to transmit the terroir, reading the earth, the smells, the daily perceptions, and converting them into wine.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My knowledge of Berlin was confined to snippets of Cabaret and its depiction of the decaying Weimar Republic and the Cold War tales of writers such as John Le Carré and Len Deighton for whom the city was always a place of shadows and intrigue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a very lengthy wait at passport control (by the efficiency of their airports shall ye judge a whole culture), we emerged on the other side, checked into our somewhat brutalist (in terms of architecture) hotel and sallied forth into the night for some swift refreshment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After ten minutes’ walk we alighted on a wine bar that on first inspection might not fill one with confidence with its shelves groaning under serried ranks of negociant wines. A friendly welcome put us at ease, and soon we were ensconced at a table with complimentary popcorn. A small gesture, but I loved it. The wine list didn’t hold a great deal of promise, but there is a tiny section devoted to orange wines. When you are not acquainted with the wines or producers on a list, then orange is arguably the safest bet. We choose an unfiltered German Roter Traminer. Wines from the Traminer family are one of my guilty pleasures, I confess to one of my traveling companions, <a href="https://www.wineanorak.com/wineblog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Jamie Goode</a>. When you are tired, or not in the mood for wine, their obviousness is a virtue. We eat a large plateful of ham and chicken skewers and feel expansive. More popcorn is brought to the table. We have arrived.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day we are due to meet with our other colleague, co-host of &#8216;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/justanotherwinepodcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Another Wine Podcast&#8217;,</a> and organizer of the Weinfest, Emily Harman, and a small group of producers at a wine shop called Mezzacantina just south of the river. It is a colourful part of town with the locals evidently bringing their full graffiti A-game. Being early, we stroll through the adjacent Goerlitzer Park, and I take a few photos of “interesting” looking local characters. &#8216;You just took a picture of a guy pissing&#8217;, hissed Jamie. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We convene soon after in front of the wine shop where Emily dispenses pet nat after pet nat to all and sundry, photos are taken, we absorb the sights and sounds of the Turkish street festival (kebaba-palooza!) are treated to a buffet lunch of mixed starters followed by some quite delicious stuffed homemade pasta. The wine flows as does the conversation, some beautiful bottles are opened, and voluble enthusiasm is the order of the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamie and I taxied to our apartment, which initially we were unable to locate then entrance and then when we did I managed to read the German instructions for entry back to front and upside down. I was interpreting the leaving instructions as the entry ones). Eventually, by dint of rattling the door knob and swearing, something gives, and we are inside (without quite knowing how).</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;You just took a picture of a guy pissing&#8217;, hissed Jamie. </span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That evening we joined Les Caves de Pyrene&#8217;s own Paul and Michelle at a swanky wine bar called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anima.berlin/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anima</a>, snagged a prized balcony table overlooking the River Spree and drank in the sunset. We ordered almost everything on the snacky menu (what, no popcorn?) and dive into the small but serviceable list, starting with an orange from Heinrich, which seems to have monopolised the fridge space in Berlin’s wine bars. After dinner, we walk to Holzmarkt to suck in some beery Berlin atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day is the Sublime Wine Fair, aka Berlin Weinfest, located in an industrial building called Napoleon Complex. We enter past various food stalls and a stacked sound stage into the arena where nearly 80 producers are opening bottles and chilling their wines.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I was not present in a buying capacity, it is always educational to nose around and evaluate what’s going on amongst the natural wine community.  The standard was high, and the range of wines and growers present illustrated how diverse the natural wine scene is, not only in Berlin but throughout the world of wine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various seminars took place throughout the afternoon, and we participated in a couple. Jamie and I were the panel for one called “Can you taste the soils?” I feel the more one delves into the subject of terroir, the less likely one is to reach a definitive conclusion. We feel that terroir exists, but can we prove other than on the pulses (and in our mouths). Undoubtedly, the soils are very particular, and each vineyard possesses a distinctive character that influences the final. Undoubtedly, the quality of the farming and the varied winemaking choices may help or hinder the expression of “terroir-ness” in the wines. And undoubtedly also, tasting terroir is very much to do with an individual’s perception of flavours. The question is that if you can discern by tasting different soil types via the impression of minerality, it would seem to suggest that the grapes, through the mechanism of the vines, take on board a portion of the character of their surroundings. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">To work with amazing material and to butcher it would be profoundly disappointing, just as if a chef were to badly overcook the finest piece of meat or fish. </span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul, the panel’s moderator, posed a question that I have never really given much thought to. “Is it better to have a wine from a great terroir that is not so well made, or a wine from a mediocre terroir that is beautifully made.” It is not a clear choice, because you need to taste every single wine or its merits to feel whether a terroir character is prominent or lacking. And tastes differ. Whilst the quality of farming is paramount so are the winemaking methods. Nothing can come of nothing, as the saying goes, and if the selected grapes don’t have the material within them, then the resultant wines won’t be interesting – even if the winemaking is as expressive as it can be. If the wine is not tricked up, then at least it is an honest attempt to capture something of the vintage and the origin. On the other hand, to work with amazing material and to butcher it would be profoundly disappointing, just as if a chef were to badly overcook the finest piece of meat or fish. In the end, terroir is a nuanced and complex issue, but then interesting wines are complex and nuanced drinks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loosely titled “The Rise &amp; Rise of Natural Wine”, the second talk, in which Emily joined Jamie and me, was intended to be part of our podcast series (<a href="https://just-another-wine.podigee.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Another Wine Podcast</a>). The subject matter was an invitation to dig into the history of natural wines before natural was a term to describe them, to understand why chemical/conventional farming and winemaking became the norm, and to trace its modern incarnation by marking certain growers, regions and wine fairs, Finally, to take the pulse of the natural wine phenomenon at the present moment. It is easy to oversimplify and to describe events as a cultural (or even countercultural) movement. When you are at an artisan wine fair and you can cut the palpable buzz with a knife, you witness the interactions between the public and the producers themselves, and you taste the energy in these wines made with no chemical inputs, you are reassured that natural wine – however one chooses to describe it – has been a positive shot in the arm for the wine industry, and has attracted a new generation of drinkers who are concerned with provenance and what goes into their wines.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has natural wine become too political for its own good? This is not a question that keeps me awake at night wondering about its ramifications.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">But it is a corollary of the question “is natural wine dead”. These are all grand pseudo-rhetorical questions that may likely impel us to take the pulse of the natural wine movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have observed on innumerable previous occasions that despite what many commentators would have us believe, there is no convincing defined natural wine movement as such as categorisation nullifies individuality. A movement itself suggests something tidal, powerful and inevitable, an organised group with a sense of purpose and direction. Instead, natural wine is a phenomenon within the greater world of wine, a very loose coalition (and that’s possibly too strong a word) of growers, importers, retailers, fair organisers and drinkers, who think along roughly similar lines, and sometimes even agree on certain principles, but have their own set of private opinions and agendas. I first constructed my own imperfect definition of natural wine 20+ years ago, and I still refine it daily and at different times of the day. So sue me etc!</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11347" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11347" style="width: 754px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/bruno-neurath-wilson-TTHvLU3GY6U-unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11347" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/bruno-neurath-wilson-TTHvLU3GY6U-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="754" height="424" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/bruno-neurath-wilson-TTHvLU3GY6U-unsplash.jpg 1567w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/bruno-neurath-wilson-TTHvLU3GY6U-unsplash-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/bruno-neurath-wilson-TTHvLU3GY6U-unsplash-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/bruno-neurath-wilson-TTHvLU3GY6U-unsplash-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/bruno-neurath-wilson-TTHvLU3GY6U-unsplash-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11347" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Credit: Bruno Neurath Wilson, Unsplash</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it boils down to it, the two words “natural and wine” can’t support a 15 bullet-pointed charter with each point containing several subsections and qualifications. If the rules for inclusion are so contentious and complex, then what is indeed the point? Natural wine was meant to liberate vignerons from traditions, the restrictions of appellation and pettifogging standards committee. The imposition of natural wine rules just so growers can go under a natural wine banner seems counter-intuitive and speaks more to the human need to put everything into neat boxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, the idea of natural wine comes down to a feeling about the wines you taste rather than the precise methods that brought them into being. For when I taste a natural wine, I feel that it is alive, full of energy (and gives me energy). I am not tasting the process, the artifice, the hand of the oenologist, rather a drink that is magically harnessed to place and time. You can’t put precise numbers to this. When you know, you know. To achieve this sense of energy in their wines, growers have to work in a particular way, but it is not the methodology alone that makes the wine taste like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If natural wine was just farmers and grapes and pure unvarnished wine, then politics should never come into the conversation. A drink is a drink is a drink for a’ that. The wine world is, however, endlessly fractured by the vagaries of human nature and ulterior motivations. Politics is people, and people have vanities and agendas, they seek to influence outcomes for their own ends, and they want to be in prime position to do so. Nowadays, we associate all governance as a tyranny of mean-minded pedants. We are enslaved by bureaucracy to such an extent that we ourselves think like bureaucrats.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, the idea of natural wine comes down to a feeling about the wines you taste rather than the precise methods that brought them into being. For when I taste a natural wine, I feel that it is alive, full of energy.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is tempting to imagine that there was a prelapsarian era when natural wine evoked excitement, interest and no little curiosity, an age of innocence when producers were constantly experimenting, trying to make wine without the safety net. I believe that was once the case and natural wine was a community of likeminded vignerons, sharing information (and equipment), pushing positively to make wine without chemicals. Making wines that they would happily drink themselves and with their fellow growers and friends. It was not always an easy transition to go from conventional to low-intervention winemaking, but natural is learning out what works and what doesn’t and how vigilant one must be to craft great wine without additives. Nature doesn’t leap. Patience is one of the ingredients of chemical-free winemaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, at the beginning, a sense of fun and adventure prevailed. Early wine fairs reflected this freewheeling mentality. It wasn’t long before casual groups began to organise into larger groups and formal agendas were tabulated. Natural wine manifestoes emerged with boxes that needed to be ticked, and committees ordained to command oversight and legitimise those that would be admitted into the fold as natural winemakers.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11348" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11348" style="width: 685px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dan-cristian-padure-aMfm78CytdE-unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-11348" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dan-cristian-padure-aMfm78CytdE-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="685" height="493" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dan-cristian-padure-aMfm78CytdE-unsplash.jpg 2100w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dan-cristian-padure-aMfm78CytdE-unsplash-300x216.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dan-cristian-padure-aMfm78CytdE-unsplash-1024x737.jpg 1024w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dan-cristian-padure-aMfm78CytdE-unsplash-768x553.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dan-cristian-padure-aMfm78CytdE-unsplash-1536x1105.jpg 1536w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dan-cristian-padure-aMfm78CytdE-unsplash-2048x1474.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11348" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Credit: Dan Cristian Padure, Unsplash</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To maintain the purity of their enterprise growers had to provide documentary proof of their “natural practice.”  The organisers of fairs seemed to forget about inclusiveness. I know of several cases where growers were excluded on the say-so of a powerful individual within a natural wine organisation. This badmouthing tarnishes the political side of natural wine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural wine (as a phenomenon) has been fortunate in its conventional opponents who have either sneered at the winemakers, importers and gullible drinkers (thereby reinforcing the stereotype of the wine snob) or described it as a massive danger to good practice and good taste.  The histrionic dislike for the mere idea that wine could be natural, rather than a rational appraisal of each wine on its merits, aroused great curiosity amongst folk in the trade as well as consumers at large who were hearing the news on the grapevine. As an idea, natural wine became part of a counter culture, a younger generation of consumers that wasn’t invested in traditional wine certainties.  The critics (and there were many) lost the essential point of the narrative, which is that individuals will drink what the hell they like (whether it is fashionable or otherwise) and come to their own conclusions. I doubt very many people ever drank natural wines if they didn’t actually like the taste and the way they made them feel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I read the other day in Raisin App that, according to their criteria for inclusion, over 3,000 producers have been identified as natural. With the profusion of restaurants, bars, cavistes, wholesalers, not to mention the hundreds of artisan wine fairs, the wines are truly embedded in our wider wine culture.  You will find examples in your local pub, independent retailer and Michelin starred establishment. The term natural wine is arguably used less now, because there are certain pejorative connotations, but the wines are still the same, what they may be called. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as tasting the wines themselves and visiting the vineyards, I still derive pleasure from discussing the subject of natural wine, talking about how certain wines move us and speculating why they move us, and why we seem to find it difficult to stomach conventional wines. I say we because most wine drinkers in my limited circle of acquaintances have been fully converted to natural wines. (And not because I fixed them with my “glittering eye”.) When we analyse our sense of taste, we learn something about ourselves in the process. Which brings us back to the recognition of a group of wines as tasting more natural (than others) and the pleasure that brings us. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where sunshine and wine combine</span></i></h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Glow-Wine-Image-1-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11339" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Glow-Wine-Image-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="626" height="434" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Glow-Wine-Image-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Glow-Wine-Image-1-300x208.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Glow-Wine-Image-1-1024x711.jpg 1024w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Glow-Wine-Image-1-768x533.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Glow-Wine-Image-1-1536x1066.jpg 1536w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Glow-Wine-Image-1-2048x1422.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The visual pleasure given to us by wine is underestimated in the overall scheme of things. We may feel that our sense of sight is less important to the overall experience of wine as we tend to use it to glean surface information, compared the complex and encompassing impressions yielded by smell and taste, which are more about tasting the wine in its entirety.  Yet our visual perception also triggers a cascade of instantaneous responses and associations and stimulate brain activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On occasions, we want to grasp a moment of intensely sensual experience &#8211; and even memorialise it. The feelings associated with the perception of something beautiful are ephemeral, as the memory of them inevitably fades or becomes furred up, the sense of awed pleasure at the very instant of the original experience diluted over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many wine lovers will therefore take a picture of the bottle and store it on their phone and/or post it on their social media feed. The picture, when retrieved, although two dimensional by definition, can trigger positively warm memories when viewed later on.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally-speaking, April was the most indulgent wine month. In terms of vino, I carped a lot of diem. Joy’s grapes were burst repeatedly</span></em></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so to balcony wines. The balcony is precious to me in this scenario, because I live in the middle of a city and it is a location which is quiet and ideal for a moment’s contemplation and is bathed in light no matter the weather. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at home when I begin to connect with a wine in a poignant way, I have this strange urge to remove it from the more formal context of the dining room and go somewhere different to make a memory with it. The ritual of taking the bottle and glass upstairs and placing them on the balcony parapet in preparation for a photo creates an expectation that further heightens one’s receptivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all wines were deemed equally worthy of being balcony wines, then would be little value to this currency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time of day is critical too. The quality and nature of the light is essential. Early evening light is characterised by a softer, diffused glow with warmer tones, especially during those twilight hours before full darkness. This is due to the lower sun angle, which results in more scattering and absorption of shorter wavelengths of light. The light is also less intense than during the day, creating a gentle, relaxing ambience and adding to the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotionally also, a beautiful sunset may give rise to simultaneous feelings of celebration and regret. Savouring those final moments (the dregs of wine, the last of daylight) feels like homage to the circadian rhythm of our lives. Although our pleasure may be tinged with regret, tomorrow will be another day with another wine. The sense of transience further sharpens our appreciation for the present, however, and prompts the desire to take a photograph as to freeze this instant of joy for eternity.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunshine and warmth transform the spectacle and make the wines glow. In every sense. As I scroll through the photos on my phone I find myself captivated by those taken during the period of spring/summer 2020, when balcony wine epiphanies (as I came to regard them) became also quotidian. The weather helped enormously, as well as the fact of the protracted lockdown which gave time to appreciate those things we take for granted. Every taste of wine seemed like a new blessing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From March through to the end of June that year I drank some of the best wines I have ever tasted. Or, to put it more accurately, I always chose what I was in the mood to drink, and the wines seemed to taste the better for that. With the sun is shining day-after-day so brilliantly boosting serotonin levels, the wines seemed bouncy and healthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I kept a wine diary for 2020 and wrote at the time:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally-speaking, April was the most indulgent wine month. In terms of vino, I carped a lot of diem. Joy’s grapes were burst repeatedly “against my palate fine”. Every evening I dutifully took a bottle and a glass to my balcony and photographed them with an all-singing, all-dancing sunset in the background (my fave photo-trope was to have the dying rays of the day slanting into the glass of – preferably orange – wine.) Natural light really does make a wine come alive and the quality of turbidity is unstrained. The final glass of murk was invariably brimming with solids, the changing hues, textures and wild flavours of the wines momentarily inspirational.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the by-products of lockdown is that we (by which I mean “I”) are drinking better. Wisely and well, not just in more copious quantities. For example, I am buying and drinking wines that I would normally only broach on very special occasions. Devil hang the expense etc. Slowing down in all aspects of my life further means that I can take pleasure in every aspect of the wine. When I pour it, I allow myself the slow luxury to examine the colour in the glass, as if admiring it for the first time. The greater the depth of colour, the more immersive the visual experience. I take time to smell, to taste, to savour, allowing the wine to envelop my senses, rather than chasing after it, so to speak. It is like remembering how to breathe.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wine in the glass shimmers and hums with colour suffused with light. The bottle must be present too, standing by its contents, like a proud mother. Colours become beautiful fluid glowing memories; labels provide the cue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colour is not fixed. Natural wine, like natural light, can be gentle, dangerous, dreamlike, bare, living, dead, misty, clear, hot, dark, violet, springlike, falling, straight, sensual, limited, poisonous, calm and soft.  And natural light seems to infuse natural wines with life.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wine in the glass shimmers and hums with colour suffused with light. The bottle must be present too, standing by its contents, like a proud mother. Colours become beautiful fluid glowing memories; labels provide the cue.</span></h2>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt this energy every year we held our big artisan wine fair at London’s Tobacco Dock. The sunshine that flooded from a cloudless sky through the glass roof imbued the tasting with a vital seasoning. The brightness naturally lift the spirits and also seem to dynamise the very pigments of the wines themselves. And what a multi-hued palette there was! Liquids that seemed to attract and hold the light, wines saturated variously with dancing mauves, crimsons, pomegranate-reds, coral-pinks, ambers, buttercup-yellows and burnished golds – a painterly spectrum indeed. Over and again one was reminded of Galileo’s effortless description of wine being “sunlight held together by water.” For whatever reason, wines tasted better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inner light exists. As the saying goes: Beauty is a light in the heart. Limpid glistening colours in wine denote healthy transparency, yet even the more turbid examples possess their own vitality. A wine which is stripped to the gills can, after all, be clear in the sense of a denatured cleanliness – what I witnessed (and felt) at the Real Wine Fair was a quality and “acoustic depth” of colour. You know it when you see it; it is as if the light – even through a glass darkly – radiates from within.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back on the balcony. The photo puts the wine, the rays from the setting sun, and pale blue sky in a single frame. Tasting the wine creates a tactile resonance that lodges deep in the memory. Now, when I look at the photo months &#8211; and even years &#8211; on, I can almost taste the wine in mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words of Pablo Neruda’s Ode To Wine seem apposite here:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you are more than love,</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-35.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11332" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-35.jpg" alt="" width="721" height="422" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-35.jpg 1039w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-35-300x176.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-35-1024x599.jpg 1024w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-35-768x449.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Substance is a label created by Myrko Tépus and Nicolas de Groot, dedicated to fermented artisan lightly sparkling natural drinks made without alcohol. The idea is inspired by vignerons to create gastronomic drinks that have similar complex aromatic profiles and textures to wine. Myrko himself makes wines in the Gorges du Verdon in Provence from naturally-farmed vineyards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The origin of the drinks comes from spring water that has its source in the Verdon gorge, in which high grade organic Sencha tea* is steeped and fermented with organic French sugar beet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The water is currently filtered using a cartridge, but eventually they will install a dynamiser. Fermentation is carried out with a mother culture (bacteria and yeast) which they maintain and perpetuate. This combines with the sugars to create the natural C02 which is trapped in the bottle. For the sake of stability, there is no secondary fermentation in the bottle with little extra CO2 added for conditioning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All fermentations and infusions take place in stainless steel tanks with the infusions occurring in cold water for a few days and the tea fermentation carried out at a temperature of 73.5 c. The proportions of tea are 5-6.5 grams per litre of spring water, while the aromats vary according to the taste they are looking to achieve but generally comprise around 5% of the whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infusions are added at the end of fermentation, except for the smoked tea for the Brume which is added at the start. None of the beverages are fined and no sulphites are added. They do filter for stability. The residual sugar is approximately 3g/l.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*The Japanese Sencha green tea leaves are not ground as with other teas. The leaves are gently steamed, rolled, shaped and then dried to capture their distinctive flavour. The rolling of the leaves creates the customary, thin and cylindrical shape of the tea leaf which has a very fine and fragile structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green tea refers to a type of tea that is not treated or processed in any way. Consequently, Sencha green tea retains its nutrients and active ingredients. The health benefits that are thought to be derived from Sencha green tea are due in large part to antioxidants, catechins, vitamin C, beta-carotene, folic acid, saponins, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus found in these nutrient-dense leaves.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-20.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11333" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-20.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="585" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-20.jpg 851w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-20-199x300.jpg 199w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-20-681x1024.jpg 681w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-20-768x1155.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Brume</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingredients: Black organic tea called Tarry Lapsang Souchong from the hills in the province de Fujian, Mont Wuyi in China and Poivre de Timut cultivated in Provence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fresh tea leaves are dried and smoked over pine and cypress wood steeped in the water. Organic sugar is added as well as the yeast/bacteria culture and the fermentation begins. The Poivre de Timut is a rustic spice originating in Nepal. It is not actually a pepper but a berry from the rue or citrus family. An infusion of this spice is added after fermentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep woody aromas enriched by notes of smoked tea and floral undertones then dried citrus and grapefruit and finally Szechuan pepper. Long intriguing finish. This can be paired with vegetable dishes or lightly cooked white fish.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-22.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11334" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-22.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="588" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-22.jpg 848w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-22-199x300.jpg 199w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-22-678x1024.jpg 678w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-22-768x1159.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Aurore</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Made from Sencha High Grade organic green tea and organic pomelo (similar to sweet grapefruit) cultivated in Provence with added distillate of Damask rose  and Rose de Grasse and finally organic hibiscus flowers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sencha High Grade Bio is a green tea of the highest quality, cultivated organically. The young tender shoots are picked in spring, and these confer delicate and refined notes. It is grown mainly in Japan notably in regions such as Shizuoka, Kagoshima and Uji. The tea is valued for its freshness, aromatic properties and high antioxidants. The two rose distillates give their delicate perfumes, which combine with notes of flowers, fruit and delicate spice and a touch of sugar and honey. The pomelo (zest only) brings balance with refreshing acidity and various tones of grapefruit. Rose-hued Aurore quickly reveals its aromas of hibiscus flower and wild meadow grass. Its effervescence is light and delicate and gives an ethereal texture. All the remaining elements combine harmoniously. The perfect aperitif, whilst also accompanying fruit-based desserts.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-21.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11335" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-21.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="590" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-21.jpg 847w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-21-199x300.jpg 199w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-21-678x1024.jpg 678w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-21-768x1161.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Solaris</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solaris is also fermented high grade organic Sencha green tea infused with organic Menton lemons (zest only) and organic Provençale saffron. The citron de Menton (Menton lemon) is emblematic of the Côte d’Azur, renowned for its quality and unique flavour. The organic Provence saffron from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">crocus sativus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a rare and precious spice, cultivated artisanally in the south of France, notably in Drôme Provençale, Vaucluse and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This delightful drink has a luminous golden colour with delicate effervescence infusing the drink with a lovely vivacity and elegant texture. Harmonious integration between the sweetness of the Menton citrus and the floral nuances care of the saffron. Solaris also works well as an aperitif or as an accompaniment to scallop carpaccio in citrus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a quick note about why Substance is so low in alcohol. Whilst the yeasts do break down the sugar to produce alcohol and CO2 as the major by-product, the bacteria also consume sugars to some degree and metabolize the alcohol into acetic acid. Only a small quantity of sugar is added at the beginning of fermentation which is then transformed into acids by the acetic bacteria and other different bacteria such as gluconic, glucuronic, tartaric and lactic are also present to consume it.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">La Luna Blanc by Bruno Duchene</h2>
<p>I have been singing the praises of cool wines, whites that evoke the crisp fluency of shallow mountain streams gliding over polished stones, firm-skinned reds that gush with tart red juice when you sink your teeth into them, been lauding the wines from the glacial screes of Savoie as well as those from the hard white limestone of northern Burgundy. Also, praising non-extractive winemaking techniques, the subtle art of infusion, and examples of vinification where the preservation of crunchy acidity imbues the wine with beautiful dynamic energy.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20161029_175652.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11276" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20161029_175652.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="390" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20161029_175652.jpg 2560w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20161029_175652-300x180.jpg 300w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20161029_175652-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20161029_175652-768x461.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20161029_175652-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20161029_175652-2048x1229.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>Also &#8211; dare one say &#8211; that it is cool to like cool wines! Jura worshippers can rhapsodise about different types of marly soils and write considered “parcel-maniacal” treatises on the altitude and aspects of their favourite cool-climate vineyards. And being appreciated in the nerd-o-sphere.</p>
<p>For all that the favourite direction of the critical wine compass seems to point to the north of the north, I am becoming increasingly drawn towards the wines of the south and the flavours of the Mediterranean.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>I am partial to white wines from fragrant citrus grapes evoking orange groves as well as the fleshy-to-dried fruit end of the flavour spectrum, wines often marked by aromas of sun-warmed dried apricot or peach-skin occasionally shot through with impressions of bleached earth and rocks and hay, or infused by bouquets of garrigue herbs and spices– fennel, marjoram, thyme, bay…</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Cool climate wines tend to be constructed on acidity which carries fruit and chalky-mineral sensations across the tongue. Wines from warmer climes have a different profile, more reflective of their surroundings. Of course, within climates, there are micro-climates that are felt in the vineyards and shape the nature of the wines.  There is the influence of the sea and the influence of the mountains, the aspect of the vineyards, the amount of sunshine received and the composition of the soils and the nature of the farming.</p>
<p>We associate Mediterranean regions with bold colours, light and heat – and exotic smells. The sort of smells that evoke colours and emotions. The paintings of Dufy, Derain and Matisse rendered into wine.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/La-Luna-Blanc_label-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11270" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/La-Luna-Blanc_label-1.jpg" alt="" width="428" height="299" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/La-Luna-Blanc_label-1.jpg 428w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/La-Luna-Blanc_label-1-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" /></a></p>
<p>The evocations are personal but there are surely some common flavour perceptions. I am partial to white wines from fragrant citrus grapes evoking orange groves as well as the fleshy-to-dried fruit end of the flavour spectrum, wines often marked by aromas of sun-warmed dried apricot or peach-skin occasionally shot through with impressions of bleached earth and rocks and hay, or infused by bouquets of garrigue herbs and spices– fennel, marjoram, thyme, bay… Technically, Med wines will have moderate to low acidity and lean into the waxy/bitter textural idiom. Complementary varieties are, however, often blended to give the final wines their ultimate balance.</p>
<p>Some of the usual (and unusual) white grape suspects from Spain, France and Italy include Vermentino (or Rolle), Malvasia (several varieties), Muscat (several types), Giro Ros, Clairette, Marsanne, Roussanne, Bourboulenc, Grenache Blanc &amp; Gris, Macabeu, Xarel.lo, Terret Blanc &amp; Gris, Piquepoul Blanc &amp; Gris, Verdicchio, Ansonica and Palomino.<a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bruno-Duchene-IGP-La-Luna-Blanc-2022.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11271" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bruno-Duchene-IGP-La-Luna-Blanc-2022.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="524" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bruno-Duchene-IGP-La-Luna-Blanc-2022.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bruno-Duchene-IGP-La-Luna-Blanc-2022-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bruno-Duchene-IGP-La-Luna-Blanc-2022-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a>This peroration has been inspired by drinking Bruno Duchene’s IGP Côte Vermeille La Luna Blanc. Côte Merveille, more like! To exploit my own favourite wine cliché, this blend of Xarel.lo, Grenache Gris &amp; Grenache Blanc tastes like “the Muscadet of the south”, by which I mean a wine that seems to have soaked up the salt air of the sea whilst simultaneously preserving the medicinal/herbal notes of the scrubland. My impression of the wine, of course. Wine has this undeniable capacity to transport you to places that you have never physically been but exist in your fond imagination. The feelgood aspect of drinking is that what appeals to your senses, eliciting real or fabricated wishful memories. The purity of a wine such as La Luna taps into some primal response centre. When I taste wine and think about grape variety, or terroir, or the skill (or otherwise) of the vigneron, I lose the deeper connection with that wine. The connection in this case is momentary, the sense of being transported is just a daydream, before the meddling intellect intervenes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Smells, words &amp; memories</em></h2>
<p>Tasting is an act of transmutation of aromas and flavours into measured and unspoken language.</p>
<p>We receive a cocktail of raw chemical and microbiological elements in liquid form, we perceive them (as data) in a way that is unique to our particular training and individual consciousness, we react accordingly, and we formulate an assessment based on a mixture of subjective feeling and objective consideration (with numerous other external and internal influences in play) which we proceed to shape into words. In certain cases, an objectifying tendency may dominate whereas in others our taste may largely be determined by emotional or visceral responses.</p>
<p>Our sense of taste is further influenced by our cultural experience and our social conditioning which provides us with the language (and reservoir of associative comparison), which we need to convert perceptions and memories into communicable form.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">When one considers that wine is a complex liaison of chemical transformations and microbiological marvels and how those of us who taste and perceive wine are changing constantly due the firing of neurons and realignment of neural pathways, it is surprising that we find the same taste in a wine from hour-to-hour let alone day to day.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Certain chemical compounds present in specific wines (and other drinks and foods) tend to trigger certain groups of common descriptors. This common ground lies in a wider recognition of the more pungent aromatics peculiar to a certain style of wine or grape variety, although how we describe the wine will ultimately depend on our experience of what we have exposed to and smelled and tasted previously.</p>
<p>For example, the volatile thiol 4-mercapto-4-methylpentan-2-one &#8211; or 4-MMP for short &#8211; is one of the aromatic compounds present in wines made from Sauvignon Blanc. The perceived taste spectrum for this grape varies between “green” (vegetative, grassy, herbaceous, asparagus, green pepper, capsicum, tomato leaf) at the one end to “tropical” (guava, grapefruit and passion fruit) with gooseberry and blackcurrant sitting somewhere in the middle. Which descriptor we end up using will naturally depend on the wine itself &#8211; as not all Sauvignons taste the same &#8211; but often we may end up selecting a group of words across the range to convey an essential impression of “Sauvignon-ess”. Perhaps this is as much to say that the more one thinks about the words one uses in the interests of conveying precise flavour-perceptions, the more words one ends up using.</p>
<figure id="attachment_11286" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11286" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/anna-evans-YbBApmAn-dw-unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11286 size-full" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/anna-evans-YbBApmAn-dw-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="488" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/anna-evans-YbBApmAn-dw-unsplash.jpg 650w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/anna-evans-YbBApmAn-dw-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11286" class="wp-caption-text"><em>photo credit: Anna Evans on Unsplash</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is easier to find equivalent descriptors for a grape variety such as Sauvignon which exhibits such dominant primary thiol-intense aromatics. When it comes to describing our perceptions of the effects of  complexing secondary aromas and flavours in a wine marked by, say, aldehyde notes (flor yeast x oxidation) we may find it trickier to summon the right words.</p>
<p>The sensory threshold for acetaldehyde ranges from 100-125 mg/l. Immediately after fermentation, wines generally have acetaldehyde levels below 75 mg/l. However, above 125 mg/l acetaldehyde can impart odours described sometimes as  ‘bruised apples’, ‘stuck-ferment’ character or ‘sherry’ and ‘nut-like’ notes. Other descriptions include “fermenting marula”; “papaya” (which seems to be a positive) or underripe avocado. Whether it is the actual quantity of acetaldehyde or the way it presents in a particular wine, putting sherry and papaya in the same family of descriptors seems an odd juxtaposition. Equally, we can’t assert that one description is more accurate than another since we are conditioned to find words that best reflect our experience and there is no objective standard for these things.</p>
<p>Sotolon, a butenolide lactone and an extremely potent aroma compound that one finds particularly in the Vin Jaune wines of Jura, exhibits a typical smell of fenugreek or curry powder at high concentrations and maple syrup, caramel, or burnt sugar at lower ones. How you probably describe the wines depends on the intensity of the aromas. If you have never smelled fenugreek or curry powder in your life, you can only make the nearest comparison. Then it becomes a matter of “the smell of this wine makes me think of…”<a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Dugois-Arbois-Vin-Jaune-2011.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11287" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Dugois-Arbois-Vin-Jaune-2011.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="524" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Dugois-Arbois-Vin-Jaune-2011.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Dugois-Arbois-Vin-Jaune-2011-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Dugois-Arbois-Vin-Jaune-2011-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a>What we taste as flavour is linked to what we smell. Wines are, however, considerably more complex than the sum total presence of those aromatic compounds which contribute to our perception of them. Our feeling about a wine extends beyond smells. A wine possesses colour (and that alone prompts various associations for the perceiver), it may also possess textural properties that unfold and coat the palate. The wine itself will change as well as its chemical composition will be affected by exposure to oxygen and temperature change not to mention reacting to the saliva in our mouths.</p>
<p>When one considers that wine is a complex liaison of chemical transformations and microbiological marvels and how those of us who taste and perceive wine are changing constantly due the firing of neurons and realignment of neural pathways, it is surprising that we find the same taste in a wine from hour-to-hour let alone day to day.  Into the tasting mixer goes the intrinsic properties of the wines themselves, those sensations, for instance, of ripeness, lees ageing, the impact of the vessel on the flavour of the wine, aromas conferred by malolactic fermentation, carbonic maceration, reduction, or oxidation. Notwithstanding the impressions given by terroir transmission. To confine the description of a wine to a simple single equivalence limited by our personal and cultural experience, is hardly do it justice, but then even the most lucid or lyrical tasting notes are partial rather than definitive.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Doug-tasting.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11288" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Doug-tasting.jpg" alt="" width="355" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>The act of summoning up experience itself is an imaginative leap. The aromas of wine may remind us of something pleasant or quite the opposite. Since we are more prone to explore likeable impressions more deeply, the pleasure centres of the brain are likely to be stimulated more intensely, and perhaps (I am speculating here), we forge a link between our favourite things.</p>
<p>The best wine smells may invite appealing memories. A soft, almost moist ocean breeze blowing through machair flowers conjuring salty sweet mellowing scents is often conjured when I sniff a natural wine made from Muscat. The sun-warmed herbs and plants of the Mediterranean garrigue are imprinted onto certain wines from the Languedoc or Provence. In my mind’s eye. The forest –  a time and a place of earthy smells, leaf mulch, and pine scent intermingled with decay and renewal is sometimes evoked when I put my nose into a Bordeaux of a certain age.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a strange metaphorical reversal, when I smell things that I love in nature, I equate them to wine. Not necessarily a specific wine, but the headiness that one associates with wine aromas. It is the best form of intoxication when you lose yourself in a world of smell which has no language other than itself. We become more of a receptor than analytic sniffer. And that’s a charm.</p>

<p>They used to say that if you ate too many carrots you would turn orange. I wonder if the same holds true for orange wine. When I am drinking one, and I am in the right frame of mind, I feel orangeness suffusing me and all that that word embodies.</p>
<p>In wine terms, orange is rarely pure as the driven orange, but probably around 50 shades of vin gris. Ranging from pink-tinted, through gold then copper into orange tones and finally rich amber. And there are hues within hues.</p>
<p>Various reasons may account for differences of colour and style such as the grape variety used, length and type of maceration (carbonic or punchdowns), the vessel used and the oxidative component of the maturation.</p>
<p>Pinot Gris, due to the colour the grape skins acquire when fully ripe, is easy to coax colour from. The pinkish-copper-hued wines of Friuli are legendary and skin-contact PG is popular elsewhere, bridging a divide between orange and rosé. Traminer is similar in this regard. Maceration is also preferred with some grape varieties such as Muscat to confer textural complexity and to dial down the more obvious aromatics. White varieties from warmer regions seem to have an affinity for skin-contact; the resultant phenolics bring a bitter characteristic that often compensates for the relative lack of acidity.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/JB-skins-cap-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11259" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/JB-skins-cap-1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="597" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/JB-skins-cap-1.jpg 437w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/JB-skins-cap-1-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Benjamin-Zidarich.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11252" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Benjamin-Zidarich.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Benjamin-Zidarich.jpg 450w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Benjamin-Zidarich-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>Longer macerations do not necessarily equate to more colour in the final wine. The colour of the skins matters most, extractive techniques and the reaction to oxygen also collectively confers deeper colours to the wine in question. Wines made in qvevri and big barrels where the process of micro-oxygenation is most apparent, tend to pick up plenty of colour. However, the same wine can be different in two vintages, if, for example, one year is a cold one and another a hot one.</p>
<figure id="attachment_11257" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11257" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Orange-pour.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-11257" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Orange-pour.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="515" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Orange-pour.jpg 400w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Orange-pour-233x300.jpg 233w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11257" class="wp-caption-text">Real Wine Fair 2024 London</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proportion of skins used to juice also governs the nature of the final wine. We think of 100% skins, but it can be as low as 10% and the reason for doing this is to add some phenolics to the wine without marking it as a full orange wine. In Georgia, for example, there is a broad east-west divide in the way that the skins and stems are used. In Kakheti, for example, it is traditional to use 100% skins (and stems) and to punch down. The resultant wines are deep bronze in colour and have a powerful tannic structure. In Imereti, for example, the wines veer towards the lighter end. 0-20% of skins are used. Because the wines are matured in qvevri and are unfiltered, the resultant wines can still have plenty of colour in their own right.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pheasants-Tears-Cellar-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11253" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pheasants-Tears-Cellar-2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="533" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pheasants-Tears-Cellar-2.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pheasants-Tears-Cellar-2-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>Skin-contact is increasingly used as a form of blending option. Part of the wine can be fermented and made separately and integrated into the final wine, alternatively as per above a certain proportion of grape skins can be added to the must. Doing this changes not only the pH and the colour, but also the very nature of the wine. It is often said that orange wines are white wines made using red winemaking techniques, but in reality these distinctions are becoming blurred. Wine does not have to be a matter of clean-skins versus colour – the colour of the grape material, the degree of extraction determines the flavour and texture profile.</p>
<p>It is also probable that orange wines are traditional in the sense that all the techniques and equipment used to make clear clean-skin wines are comparatively recent. The anti-oxidant properties of skins were probably also useful if the wine was not kept in a stable cool environment.</p>
<p>The earliest amber/orange wines Les Caves listed were a Sauvignon from Dario Princic and the famous La Stoppa Ageno (predominantly from the Malvasia di Candia Aromatico). Orange wines became more recognised internationally due to the efforts of Gravner and Radikon. Their influence spread amongst growers in central Europe, at first. Meanwhile Georgia was gradually being opened to wine tourism and many growers from around the world visited the so-called cradle of wine civilisation and returned home enthused by new-old winemaking techniques.</p>
<p>Terroirs Wine Bar was probably the first in the UK to have a whole section dedicated to skin-contact wines. This grew from one page to several over the years reflecting the range and diversity of this category of wines – the fourth colour as some critics characterised it. The Les Caves’s wine portfolio now lists over one hundred examples, too many to be grouped under the simple reductive banner of “orange wines.” We have decided to list them in degrees ranging from light skin influence through moderate to full amber with rich in colour and polyphenolic impact.</p>

<p>Amber/orange wines with their textural subtlety and complexity seem to tap into other areas. The best of these wines, when we feel them in our mouth, give us the impression that we are touching them with many other parts of our body at the same time. With these wines, however, you must start with their evocative colour, which resonates on so many levels. Orange, for example, combines the energy of red and the happiness of yellow. It is associated with joy, sunshine and heat. It also represents enthusiasm, fascination, happiness, creativity, determination, attraction, success, encouragement, and stimulation.</p>
<p>Wine-tasting notes are based on clear distinctions and precise evaluative terminology – of oppositions between white versus red, the clean skin versus maceration, and describing the relative body of the wine in question. You can call a wine unfiltered or cloudy, but that doesn’t come close to describing the quality of its colour. When we have a wine that has a colour that seems to shift according to the light, that possesses a special energy of its own, aromatics that are more than primary, and a texture that is multi-rhythmic and multi-layered, then this is a wine that by its very nature has the wherewithal to bathe our senses in ambient pleasure and evoke ASMR.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If amber wines were music, they would be as live performances, fuzzy, rough-edged and unpredictable. Their tactility means that you can touch them at the same time as they touch you. And like the best live music, they may give one a peculiar frisson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Having had the pleasure of working with Te Whare Ra as their UK importer for nearly a decade, it comes as no real surprise that Anna and Jason have been showered with accolades at <a href="https://www.therealreview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Real Review</a> 2025. Their passion, attention to detail and commitment to natural wine making is second to none. We are tremendously proud of their achievement. Below is a press release explaining in their own words what this landmark moment means for the winery.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Te Whare Ra recognized as one of New Zealand’s most iconic wineries</h2>
<figure id="attachment_11299" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11299" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Anna-nd-jason-sorted-Gewurztraminer-copy.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11299 size-full" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Anna-nd-jason-sorted-Gewurztraminer-copy.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="434" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Anna-nd-jason-sorted-Gewurztraminer-copy.jpg 650w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Anna-nd-jason-sorted-Gewurztraminer-copy-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11299" class="wp-caption-text">© Te Whare Ra</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are beyond thrilled to share the news that we have been named as the inaugural NZ Vigneron of the Year and have been ranked at number three NZ winery by the esteemed panel of wine critics at the <a href="https://www.therealreview.com/wine-regions/nz/top-wineries/2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Real Review in their 2025 awards</a>.</p>
<p>And if that wasn’t exciting enough our 2023 Single Vineyard Rose has been awarded NZ Rose of the Year!</p>
<p>Our whole team are absolutely over the moon with this amazing vindication of years of hard work and dedication to producing wines of the highest possible quality. Our region is often not recognized in this way and so we have been on a mission to change that.</p>
<p>Our vision when we took over Te Whare Ra in 2003 was to play the long game over pursuing quick wins and so we focused on producing wines of the highest quality possible from day one. We wanted to take this Marlborough icon back to its former glory and to be recognized in its rightful place amongst the top estates in the country and we have poured our hearts and soul into that for the last 22 yrs so this really is a momentous moment for us. We knew we never wanted to be the biggest (and we were well behind in that race anyway) but we wanted to be one of the best in NZ.</p>
<figure id="attachment_11298" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11298" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TWR_1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11298 size-full" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TWR_1.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="433" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TWR_1.jpg 650w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TWR_1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11298" class="wp-caption-text">© Te Whare Ra</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Real Review annual Top Winery rankings and awards are the only wine accolades globally that take into account the consistent quality of a winery’s whole range and they also have the most comprehensive insight into the wines of New Zealand and with a panel of Stephen Wong MW, Jane Skilton MW and Dr Jo Burzynska  that’s why this acknowledgment of all our hard work over countless hours – year in and year out – means the absolute world to us.</p>
<p>At every step of the growing and making process we do whatever is needed to ensure that we can make wines that are world class – those steps are often slower, more expensive and they also require meticulous attention to detail but we know that to get where we want to get to that they are necessary. We hold ourselves and our wines to the highest standards and have focused on this level of quality across the board &#8211; with the same focus on each varietal and every single batch. We truly believe that Marlborough is a region capable of greatness and it just needs some love and care to get there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2005, Pablo and his wife Andrea left their jobs (he was a nursery teacher, and she had studied political science) to become winegrowers in Ribera del Duero. Andrea started from scratch: she studied oenology and learnt how to work the vines and drive a tractor. Pablo had inherited an old vineyard which had been planted 80 years earlier by his great grandparents. Nowadays they grow 22 hectares. Andrea makes the wine; Pablo works the vineyards.</p>
<figure id="attachment_11230" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11230" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/photo-credit_Fernando-Arranz_©Magna-Vides.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11230 size-full" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/photo-credit_Fernando-Arranz_©Magna-Vides.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="438" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/photo-credit_Fernando-Arranz_©Magna-Vides.jpg 650w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/photo-credit_Fernando-Arranz_©Magna-Vides-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11230" class="wp-caption-text">©Magna Vides.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have named many of the plots after the people who farmed them for such a long period. Just over half are old vines, between 70 and 110 years old, and the rest are new plantings from cuttings taken from their own vineyards.</p>
<p>The vineyards are located in cooler micro-climates, oriented north to northwest at an altitude of 850 metres above sea level. The fantastic limestone and calcareous clay soils help to imbue the wines with their ultimate freshness. (The soils of these villages are varied; it is unusual to have a uniform plot. They are generally clayey and calcareous, which naturally maintains coolness for the soil and plants. The surfaces are sand, pebbles, soft clay, and limestone.)</p>
<p>Although Tinto Fino (also known as Tinto Pais – a variant of Tempranillo) reigns supreme, this region was also once planted to other interesting varieties include Albillo Mayor, Bobal, Garnacha Blanca, Garnacha Tintorera, Garnacha Comunario, Pirulesa, Alarije, and at least three varieties that they have yet to identify! These rare grapes make their way into the blends and serve to lighten the wines.</p>
<figure id="attachment_11231" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11231" style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Albillo-Mayor_photo-credit_Andrea-Arranz_©Magna-Vides.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11231 size-full" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Albillo-Mayor_photo-credit_Andrea-Arranz_©Magna-Vides.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="488" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Albillo-Mayor_photo-credit_Andrea-Arranz_©Magna-Vides.jpg 450w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Albillo-Mayor_photo-credit_Andrea-Arranz_©Magna-Vides-277x300.jpg 277w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11231" class="wp-caption-text">Albillo-Mayor_photo credit_Andrea Arranz_©Magna Vides</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The estate has different plots with different management methods, especially with regards to the soil. Tractor ploughing, ploughing with horses, plant cover or mulching with plant debris are some of the methods used. Fertilizers are always organic matter that are added to the soil to maintain a balance. They like interspersing the vines with herbs and flowers.</p>
<p>Other methods to maintain vineyard health include detailed green pruning with leaf removal, thinning, and defoliation throughout the summer, ensuring ventilation within the vines, aerating the bunches, and improving overall fruit quality. They intervene as little as possible in terms of treatments, seeking a balance between fungi and insects, in the interests of promoting the most diverse fauna, flora, and fungi &#8211; an abundant biodiversity that can regulate itself.</p>
<p>Once the grapes get to the winery, their handling respects the quality of the ingredients. Harvested by hand in boxes of up to 15 kilos, these grapes are destemmed in each tank. Manual pumping and punching down takes place, followed by fermentation with native and organic in small tanks and barrels to perfectly control the temperature and maceration of each plot or variety separately. They gently press, separating the wines. Malolactic fermentation is spontaneous, and ageing occurs in French oak barrels, 15% new and the rest used (except for the Vera Vides – see below).</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Magna-Vides-Ribera-del-Duero-Tinto-2022.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11232" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Magna-Vides-Ribera-del-Duero-Tinto-2022-410x1024.jpg" alt="" width="205" height="512" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Magna-Vides-Ribera-del-Duero-Tinto-2022-410x1024.jpg 410w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Magna-Vides-Ribera-del-Duero-Tinto-2022-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Magna-Vides-Ribera-del-Duero-Tinto-2022.jpg 420w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Magna Vides </strong>might be said to the flagship wine of the estate and celebrates the viticulture and winemaking tradition of the region. Comprising 75% Tinto fino, 5% Albillo Mayor and 20% other native red varieties, the grapes are harvested when they are tasted and deemed to be at optimal ripeness. Each variety is fermented separately with gentle maceration taking place, and the wine is aged for 16 months in a mix of 400-500 litre French oak barrels and demijohns. After a light filtration and a modest amount of sulphites added, the wine is bottled. This Ribera del Duero reveals a complex nose of blue and black fruits and spice. It’s full-bodied but without being heavy and one receives an impression of minerality care of the special terroir.</p>

<p><strong>Vera Vides</strong> is the baby wine, harvested early (Sept 6th) for a fresher style of red. Tinto Fino, Bobal and a bunch of rare and forgotten varieties are co-fermented with native yeasts and then aged for 10 months in used 500-litre French oak barrels. This is a delightful medium-bodied, super drinkable style of Ribera with a melange of black and red fruits on the nose, a touch of spice, fruity, juicy, fresh palate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The grapes we don’t talk about</strong></h2>
<p>They don’t call us the company that sells wines from 250 grape varieties for nothing. Actually, no-one calls us that, but this is to let you know that we do venerate the rare, obscure and precious things even if it is not written into our constitution.</p>
<p>Growers love to work with these varieties because it helps them to understand their territory and also creates a link to the former wines from the region. Some varieties are rarer than others, some have been transplanted into other regions or have obscure origin stories. Certain vignerons collect rare grapes like stamp collectors, others have found or bought or revived co-planted vineyards or taken cuttings or sourced from local nurseries.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>They don’t call us the company that sells wines from 250 grape varieties for nothing.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>At Les Caves, we love and celebrate diversity. Different grapes show different flavours especially when allied to sensitive farming and a respect for the terroir and the very nature of the place where they originate.</p>

<figure id="attachment_11239" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11239" style="width: 297px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/©Domaine-Thierry-Navarre.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11239 size-full" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/©Domaine-Thierry-Navarre.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="397" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/©Domaine-Thierry-Navarre.jpg 297w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/©Domaine-Thierry-Navarre-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11239" class="wp-caption-text">© Domaine Thierry Navarre</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thierry Navarre is a fan of the forgotten varieties ( <em>les cépages oubliés</em> as he describes them) and makes henstoothsome wines from the following: Terret Gris, Terret Blanc, Ribeyrenc Blanc, Oeillades and Ribeyrenc Noir. Several of these naturally ripen early and come in at low abvs &#8211;  which make their juice ideal components for blending  &#8211; but they are also fascinating in their right. Oeillades (a relation to Cinsault) and Ribeyrenc (also known as Aspiran Noir) seem to produce  twinkle-eyed floral, red-fruited wines with nuances of herbs and white pepper, a far cry from the more muscular Grenache and Carignan which dominate this region.</p>
<p>Clos du Gravillas, located in the beautiful stony terroir of Saint-Jean-de-Minervois has long exalted the former ugly duckling Carignan (now more widely appreciated), but over the years John and Nicole Bojanowski have also acquired parcels of the lesser-appreciated varieties such as Counoise and Piquepoul Gris. Meanwhile, in Trausse-Minervois, Jean-Baptiste Senat has planted Piquepoul Noir in response to global warming. With its lighter alcohol, it gives freshness and levity to blends.</p>
<p>In South West France we work with several growers who honour the history of their regions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert Plageoles (Florent and Romain’s grandfather) was an enthusiastic historian, writing two books- one about the local Gaillac grape varieties and another about local viticultural and wine-making traditions. He and all members of the Plageoles family have made the conservation and protection of traditional indigenous Gaillac grape varieties their <em>“conservatoire ampelographique”</em>, an unrivalled collection of grape varieties that had been abandoned local vignerons after their own vines were destroyed by the phylloxera in the nineteenth century. The Plageoles subsequently planted the fourteen historical Gaillacoise grape varieties: notably, the white Ondenc, and Verdanel, all seven of the different varieties of Mauzac, and Mauzac Noir, Prunelart and Braucol for the reds. They made their name with a wide range of natural and terroir-driven “confidential wines”, some of which recreate the traditional wines once made in Gaillac, most notably the ‘Vin de Voile’ (aged for seven years in barrel, in a similar way that the Jura’s Vin Jaune is made), the ‘Vin d’Autan’ (a vin liquoreux) and the Mauzac Nature (the traditional sparkling wine of Gaillac).</p>
<figure id="attachment_11241" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11241" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Plageoles-might-be-Ondenc.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11241" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Plageoles-might-be-Ondenc.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="434" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Plageoles-might-be-Ondenc.jpg 682w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Plageoles-might-be-Ondenc-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11241" class="wp-caption-text">Ondenc</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there is the red cuvée called <em>Terroirists. </em>The story is that Romain Plageoles celebrated his return to the family winery (having worked in London) by hatching a wheeze with bro’ Florent to create a simple <em>vin de soif</em> blend from the rare and forgotten ancient Gaillacoise grape varieties that Robert and Bernard had assembled in their conservatoire. The two brothers thus made a co-ferment of a baker’s dozen plus two including Nebelescol, Piquepoul Gris, Marrocain, Morrastel, Mourtes, Jurançon Noir, Prunelart Noir and Blanc, Verdanel, an assortment of types of Duras and a lickety-lick of Mauzac Vert. The label says it all, a fist-punching, glass-brandishing celebration of terroir and drinkability and sucks-boo to all things appellation.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Clos Lapeyre:</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Camaralet, the lost grape of Jurançon</strong></h2>
<p>Jean-Bernard Larrieu at Clos Lapeyre use the white grapes of Gascony and the Pyrenees: Gros Manseng, Petit Manseng and Petit Courbu for his dry and sweet Jurançon wines. More recently, in the spirit of ampelographical curiosity, he planted vines from the ancient Caramalet grape in a lieu-dit called Mantoulan, 500m west of the Clos Lapeyre domaine.</p>
<p>New/old grape alert and consequent digression:</p>
<p>Camaralet de Lasseube, or simply<em> Camaralet</em>, is an ancient and strongly flavoured French white-wine grape variety on the verge of extinction. It is primarily used as a blending component in Jurançon’s whites wines along with varieties such as Petit Manseng, Gros Manseng and Petit Courbu. In 2000, just half an acre of Camaralet de Lasseube remained in southwestern France.</p>

<p>Its decline is in part due to an unusual characteristic: it is a female vine, not hermaphroditic like most other vines. This means that it must be planted very closely with other vines in order to pollinate, either male or hermaphrodite. This peculiarity makes it more of a challenge in the vineyard, along with its low yields.</p>
<p>The grapes from this 1.5 ha plot are harvested by hand. After slow pressing, the slightly settled juices ferment slowly in foudres (aged 1 to 5 years), before spending one further year on lees (regularly stirred) in vats and six months in vats before being bottled after two winters. The wine itself is extraordinary &#8211; rich in body and golden in autumnal fruit character. Bright amber, somewhat waxy, with a half-nutty oxidative nose featuring complex aromas of rhubarb, pink grapefruit, marzipan and ripe green apples. The finish is particularly long with a pleasing interplay between bruised orchard fruits and ripe citrus and even herbs.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Albert de Conti La Vigne d’Albert:</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Honouring the grandfather</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gendres-La-Vigne-dAlbert.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11245" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gendres-La-Vigne-dAlbert.jpg" alt="" width="343" height="468" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gendres-La-Vigne-dAlbert.jpg 343w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gendres-La-Vigne-dAlbert-220x300.jpg 220w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px" /></a></p>
<p>This is another example of looking back to look forward. The Conti family has always focused on the farming, bringing the soil back to life and preserving the environment for future generations. The winemaking has moved over the years away from new oak and extraction towards more delicate fruit flavours and deliciousness. This particular cuvée is emblematic of that journey being made from Périgord (Mérille), Abouriou, Merlot, Cabernets (Franc and Sauvignon), Côt et Fer. It was this plot that Albert, Guillaume’s grandfather, took grapes for his wine of the year, vinified without sulphur. An homage to him, therefore. a wine as he made them, as he loved them! La Vigne d’Albert sports intense aromas of fresh &amp; ripe fruit combined with a soft floral note. You could drink it from the jug, lightly chilled.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Savoie-Faire: </strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Yann Pernuit’s local knowledge</strong></h2>
<p>Les Vins de Belema Yann Pernuit’s project in Ayze in the Haute-Savoie. Yann has worked in the region for fifteen years, often as a biodynamic consultant, where he supervised the conversion of Château de la Merande to this proactive method of farming. Having bought grapes originally for his negoce project, Yann planted vines in 2015 on a 1.5-hectare plot of mixed limestone scree, marls and red clay soils, all to indigenous alpine grapes such as Mondeuse, Etraire de la D’huy, and Altesse. Excitingly, he had also taken cuttings from Dominique Belluard’s vineyard (Dominique was his friend and mentor) of the rare indigenous Gringet grape and planted these. The resulting wine does great justice to Dominique’s iconic wines.</p>
<p>The Imago (the name works on two levels of the meaning of the word) is a lovely wine, light in body, yet rich, complex and spicy in flavour. Fermented and aged in sandstone jars and terracotta eggs, this Gringet is textural with notes of meadow-flowers, beeswax, pear-skin and cinnamon. Really nourishing with terrific energy. The red, called Sans Pareil, features Etraire de la D’huy alongside Mondeuse, and has a wonderful <em>al dente</em> quality with sappy fruit and finely-grained tannins.</p>
<p>The Savoie region is a wonderful repository of local grape varieties that often transmit the unique nature of the mountainous terrain.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Loire unto themselves</strong></h2>
<p>Over in the forests of the Sologne, arch-terroirist and rule-flouter extraordinaire Claude Courtois and sons work with historic <em>Gascon, Romorantin</em> and <em>Menu Pineau</em>. Secret field blends featuring these appear in their cuvées called Racines and Nacarat. If you were to ask which outlawed varieties might feature in these particular wines, you would be met with the deadest of dead bats, for grape patrimony for them is not always about teasing out and isolating the individual varieties but using them in conjunction with others to express a certain inalienable truth about the terroir.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cailloux-du-Paradis-LIcaunais-2022.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11247" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cailloux-du-Paradis-LIcaunais-2022.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="524" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cailloux-du-Paradis-LIcaunais-2022.jpg 420w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cailloux-du-Paradis-LIcaunais-2022-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cailloux-du-Paradis-LIcaunais-2022-410x1024.jpg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a></p>
<p>Having said that, Etienne Courtois still make a 100% Gascon (called L’Icaunais – the unknown one). The parentage (parenthood) is unclear. It does not come from Gascony (that much is known), but probably from the area around Orléans in the Département Loiret in central northern France and has an abundance of synonyms – including Abondance. The grape as already mentioned as Rochelle Noire in 1667. Supposedly, around 1-hectare of this variety is planted and at one heady time we had two iterations on our list. The wines are/were both inky red with high acidity, slightly funky and refreshingly unique.</p>

<p>Menu Pineau is a very old grape that has been cultivated in the Loire Valley since at least the 16th century, where it was first mentioned in print by François Rabelais. It is also referred to as Arbois/Orbois, which is a corruption of the name <em>Herbois</em>, which is what the grape was called in the Loir-et-Cher region where it is most widely grown. In the local dialect, Herbois was spelled/pronounced Orboé or Orboué, which ultimately became Orbois and then Arbois (nothing to do with the region in Jura).</p>
<p>Our pure example is Brin de Chevre, the cadastral name of the vineyard in the Touraine belonging to the Puzelat family. Planted around 80 years ago, parts of it are being replaced with massale selection cuttings.<a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tue-Boeuf-Brin-de-Chevre-Blanc-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11248" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tue-Boeuf-Brin-de-Chevre-Blanc-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="472" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tue-Boeuf-Brin-de-Chevre-Blanc-scaled.jpg 1138w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tue-Boeuf-Brin-de-Chevre-Blanc-133x300.jpg 133w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tue-Boeuf-Brin-de-Chevre-Blanc-455x1024.jpg 455w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tue-Boeuf-Brin-de-Chevre-Blanc-768x1728.jpg 768w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tue-Boeuf-Brin-de-Chevre-Blanc-683x1536.jpg 683w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tue-Boeuf-Brin-de-Chevre-Blanc-910x2048.jpg 910w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a></p>
<p>In the glass the wine was a medium golden bronze color and was a little bit hazy. The nose is usually intense with bruised apple and pear, peach stone and honeysuckle aromas. The palate is characterised flavours of apple cider and fresh cut green apples along with apricot, honey and lemony citrus. In cooler vintages, the wine has a delicious nerve to it, in warmer years the fruit is waxier.</p>
<p>Menu Pineau also features as a component in the 10 grape multi-blend called Racines Blanc made by the Courtois family.</p>
<p>A mention in dispatches for the Romorantin grape. Legend has it that Romorantin was introduced to the Loire by King Francis 1 (1494–1547). The commune of Romorantin-Lanthenay not far from the grape&#8217;s stronghold in Cheverny, suggesting that the grape&#8217;s name reflects a geographical connection &#8211; the king was from the region.</p>
<p>DNA fingerprinting has shown that it is one of many grapes to be the result of a cross between Gouais Blanc and Pinot Fin Teinturier, making it a sibling of Chardonnay, amongst others.</p>
<p>Romorantin is the designated grape for Cour-Cheverny appellation and around thirty producers work with it. Its reputation is being secured by natural wine growers who see its potential and are able to produce extraordinary wines from it.</p>
<p>Back with Puzelat. The family have worked with the grape for some time. Originally, it was as part of a joint project with Pierre-Olivier Bonhomme and a centenarian vineyard (planted on French rootstock). This wine was a veritable <em>vin de garde</em> and had an intensity that lingered remarkably on the palate. Aromas jostled for attention: lemon and chalk followed by mixed white fruits (white peaches, Mirabelle plums, pears), honey, almonds and clean, minerally scents reminiscent of finely-spun wool. It was complex on the palate, too, extremely vinous showing lemon-cream and honey. Ripe apple juiciness gave way to tart, steely acidity that sings like a taut violin string, providing balance and structure for the full, luscious fruit. On the second day the acidity became steelier and more penetrating, the flinty minerality more pronounced taking on back notes of ginger, white pepper, pear-skin and hell’s granny smiths…</p>
<p>More recent versions have been from younger vineyards planted to selection massale vines. From here, the wines are more fluid, expressing a bright chalky freshness.</p>

<p>Hervé Villemade, in Cour-Cheverny, makes two versions of Romorantin. We import “Les Acacias”, a wine characterised by its power and sheer intensity. Here the fleshy apricot fruit melds with a touch of oxidation and creates a multi-layered wine with liquorice bitters, warm ginger and fine tannins.</p>
<p>“Nature admits no lie”, as Carlyle said, and Courtois (Claude) often says that his wine is made from “true grapes.” The wines he and Etienne craft are pure and vibrantly alive, testament to outstanding farming and precise winemaking. Claude, as we know, is one of the wild men of the region, fierce, generous and capricious, guiding beautiful, naturally expressive wines to the bottle. There is something about Romorantin with almost sherry aromas of oxidation and this example grows in the glass as if eating the oxygen that should be destroying it. The texture evolves into lanolin, warmth pervades the mouth. It is like nothing you have ever tasted, and one imagines that every time one tries the wine it will be a different experience.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Stay tuned!</h2>
<p>Next time, we explore the Georgian grape heritage, look at some rare wines from the Lebanon, pop into Italy to remind ourselves of its rich vinicultural heritage and finish in Spain, where ancient varieties seem to be coming back into fashion.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.champagne-eric-taillet.fr/le-domaine?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Champagne Eric Taillet</a> is based in Baslieux-sous-Châtillon in the Belval Valley. The domain is composed of 6 hectares of Meunier for the most part (82%), a little bit of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir and some forgotten varieties like Pinot Gris, Petit Meslier and Arbane. Eric jokes he was baptised in Champagne and that he became a winemaker as a result.</p>
<figure id="attachment_11216" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11216" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/©Champagne-Eric-Taillet.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11216 size-full" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/©Champagne-Eric-Taillet.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="343" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/©Champagne-Eric-Taillet.jpg 650w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/©Champagne-Eric-Taillet-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11216" class="wp-caption-text">©Champagne Eric Taillet</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founded in 1956, Champagne Taillet marketed its first bottles in 1961. Eric (fourth generation) took over the domaine in 1995 with modern and sustainable ideas while focusing on manual work in the vines. His winemaking philosophy is a little different from what is usually done in the area. He is inspired by the phrase ‘Meunier, tu dors” (Meunier, you sleep) meaning you must leave it alone. The less one intervenes, the better it will express itself. Most of the cuvées are made with Meunier only. Today, Eric works alongside his children Dylan and Léna Taillet.</p>
<figure id="attachment_11217" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11217" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinot-Meunier_©Champagne-Eric-Taillet.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-11217 size-full" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinot-Meunier_©Champagne-Eric-Taillet.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="499" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinot-Meunier_©Champagne-Eric-Taillet.jpg 400w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pinot-Meunier_©Champagne-Eric-Taillet-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11217" class="wp-caption-text">Pinot Meunier ©Champagne Eric Taillet</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Marne Valley, a Champagne sub-region, has a cool, continental climate with moderate oceanic influence, making it suitable for growing grapes that produce high-acidity, low-alcohol wines, particularly Pinot Meunier.</p>
<p>The estate’s philosophy follows an organic system. Passionate about nature and preserving the delicate ecology of the environment, over the years Eric has reduced treatments and procedures, gained certification with HVE (Haute Valeur Environmentale) and VDC, and has begun using organic and biodynamic methods (infusions etc). He prefers not being certified as he enjoys the flexibility and being able to adapt as he goes, particularly in respect of the Meunier. For example, he has just started using viti-forestry (planting trees between the vines).</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Taillet-Champagne-EgaliT-Brut.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11218" src="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Taillet-Champagne-EgaliT-Brut-410x1024.jpg" alt="" width="205" height="512" srcset="https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Taillet-Champagne-EgaliT-Brut-410x1024.jpg 410w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Taillet-Champagne-EgaliT-Brut-120x300.jpg 120w, https://blog.lescaves.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Taillet-Champagne-EgaliT-Brut.jpg 420w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Egali’T Brut</strong> is 95% Pinot Meunier, 2.5% Chardonnay, 2.5% Pinot Noir from approximately 45-year-old vines. Manually harvested grapes are fermented with indigenous yeasts and then aged in stainless steel tanks with about 9 months on lees. After tirage the wine undergoes a period of 36 months maturation sur lattes. This wine is made from a perpetual reserve from 2011 to 2020. Unfined, unfiltered, unsulphured and only 2.5 g/l dosage.</p>
<p>The wine opens boldly with white-fleshed fruit such as pear and peach. Delicate touches of hawthorn, mint and green tea follow and develops into lightly toasted brioche. A beautiful combination of</p>
<p>lemon aromas brings a lively, dynamic palate. An excellent introduction to the wines of this part of the champagne region.</p>

<p><strong>Bansionensi</strong> is part of the history of the village of Baslieux-sous-Châtillon, from which it takes its Latin name. The village at the heart of the Belval valley, where Meunier is king. A rigorous selection of two vines planted on clay, limestone and flint gives true expression to this 100% Meunier cuvée. The wine is aged in oak barrels for nine months, then a further 48 months sur lattes. Dosage is 1.5 g/l.</p>
<p>This champagne is characterised by its almost exotic fruit and citrus</p>
<p>aromas. Expressive and complex it is smooth, elegant and silky. The palate is clean, bright, structured and long.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Red fruit day</strong></h2>
<p>It’s me, isn’t it? When a wine I love one year because its particularly snappy and sappy quality tips over into something that I kind of like, but don’t love.</p>
<p>For reds I am predisposed to enjoy wines which are on the red fruit spectrum. They gush, like wild berries popping in the mouth. I wonder if there is a marked difference in the alcohol levels between vintage – and no they are the same. Did the grape skins get a bit of burn on them? No, it’s the juice itself. It feels darker, heavier. Red segues into dark blue, even black.</p>
<p>I feel the disappointment more keenly with wines that I know, probably because I have taste memories lodged in my brain and my mouth is thus watering in anticipation of delicious gratification. A wine’s unwonted astringency or pronounced liqueur flavour upsets my anticipation. Natural fluidity has been subsumed in substance.</p>
<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with ripe-fruited red wines. For me, however, the sensation of red in a wine is equivalent to life-blood, a coursing energy that makes me feel good, with the crunchy red cherry on the top.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Of UK natural wine fairs</strong></h2>
<p>I was invited down to Brighton by the organisers Pour Choices to give a couple of short talks at the wine fair. The subject was the past, present and future of UK natural wines. Even as little as five years ago, this was not a subject that we would be talking back. There is no past to speak of, there is a discombobulated present &#8211; of sorts. Not a full-fledged natural scene, but the odd green shoot such as the fair above, LOW in Margate, Real Wine in the Vines and tastings promoted by Under The Bonnet Wines. Natural wine, however, is not just about local small growers here with their different agenda, it is a worldwide community of artisan vignerons and their supporters, and UK growers are only at the very early stages of penetrating the consciousnesses of consumers and wine opinion formers in other countries.</p>

<p>English wine has yet to have a clear identity. Perhaps, because it has several identities. We hear a lot about traditional method sparkling wines, more now about Pinot Noir (the most planted grape variety) and Chardonnay. The so-called heritage grape varieties, those Germanic crossings planted mainly in the 1960s and 1970s are being sidelined. A few regenerative growers are looking at hybrids (or PiWis) as an option to assist low-input farming. Other than a handful of trial vineyards with a few rows of vines, there isn’t a lot of variety.</p>
<p>Organics is just establishing itself, there are a tiny handful of biodynamic growers and regenerative is more talked about than practised. We don’t have the familial culture of vineyards and wineries being handed down the generations. But the UK does have its fair share of mavericks and individuals dedicated to pursuing their passion projects outside the mainstream wine industry.</p>
<p>And these small wine fairs provide excellent opportunities to gain a contemporaneous overview of the natural wine scene.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>A rosé is a rosé is a rosé ~ that seasonal thang</strong></h2>
<p>Just as teenagerdom starts much earlier nowadays than back when I were a hormonal lad, so the consumption of rosé wines has been pushed back from early summer to almost the end of winter. Not sure if that simile fits, but let’s go for it. This year, in a shock to the systems of vitamin D deprived folk, the sun emerged from purdah and stayed resolutely out. Lo, cafés and pubs disgorged their human contents onto the pavement, parks became carpeted with sun-worshipping bodies. And rosé sales went as high as the pollen level. Nothing says I am sloughing off the winter blues and celebrating the new year more than a bottle of triple-filtered Provençale (stylee) pink wine, so pale that it could give tap water a run for its colour money. Not that everything is rosy either. Consider also the spritz. Txakoli sales are booming because who doesn’t want a beaker of Biscayan fermented sea spray in the form of a green-tinted spritzer?</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In trendy natty wine world, there is a love for the cool things in life. White Burgundy, Jura of all hues, Loire (especially Chenin) and Cab Franc and Savoie. Whither the wines from the Mediterranean regions, the arc from Roussillon to Provence? The wines represent terrific value, but maybe the main thing that both sets them apart from the classic natty vibe is their taste profile. Whites, in particular, struggle unless they are at the house wine end of the spectrum. Oh, and Picpoul, which has been the flavour of the month for a decade. Vermentino? Definitely on the up-and-up (just don’t call it Rolle). Marsanne &amp; Roussanne. But Grenache Blanc &amp; Gris, Clairette, Terret, Macabeu. All the grapes have their own identities, of course, but share garrigue herbal notes, white spices and ripe citrus towards waxiness of texture. Compare to the higher acid wines from more northerly climates.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>2020 wine vision ~ nostalgia is the best medicine</strong></h2>
<p>Was flicking through my photos of past years deleting the blurry ones (about half of all that I had taken) when I came to 2020, specifically the lockdown period during the pandemic. It was a horrible time for many, but I certainly remember one upside: the glorious weather, week after week of crystalline blue skies, explosive sunsets, and drinking the most amazing wine. I felt the world was taking a break from noisy humanity, in fact, we were taking a break from our lives and from each other. This is entirely personal – if you had to work through the pandemic or loved ones became ill, you will not understandably relate to this. But it made me think that we enjoy wine most when the weather is fabulous (sorry, winter reds) and without noisy distraction. No wine tastings. Happy days. You become grateful for every small mercy.</p>
